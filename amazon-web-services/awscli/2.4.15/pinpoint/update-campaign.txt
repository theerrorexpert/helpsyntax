                            Silent push notifications can be  used  for  cases
                            such  as updating an app's configuration, display-

                            again.

                               key -> (string)

                               value -> (structure)
                                   Specifies metric-based criteria for includ-
                                   ing  or excluding endpoints from a segment.
                                   These criteria derive from  custom  metrics
                                   that you define for endpoints.

                                   ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                      The  operator to use when comparing met-
                                      ric   values.    Valid    values    are:
                                      GREATER_THAN,                 LESS_THAN,
                                      GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL,
                                      LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL, and EQUAL.

                                   Value -> (double)
                                      The value to compare.

                        FilterType -> (string)
                            The  type  of event that causes the campaign to be
                            sent. Valid values are: SYSTEM, sends the campaign
                            when  a  system event occurs; and, ENDPOINT, sends
                            the campaign when  an  endpoint  event  (Eventsre-

                        paign schedule use each  recipient's  local  time.  To
                        base  the schedule on each recipient's local time, set
                        this value to true.

                     QuietTime -> (structure)
                        The default quiet time for the campaign. Quiet time is
                        a  specific  time  range  when a campaign doesn't send
                        messages to endpoints, if all the following conditions
                        are met:

                        o The  EndpointDemographic.Timezone  property  of  the
                          endpoint is set to a valid value.

                        o The current time in  the  endpoint's  time  zone  is
                          later  than  or  equal  to the time specified by the
                          QuietTime.Start property for the campaign.

                        o The current time in the endpoint's time zone is ear-
                          lier than or equal to the time specified by the Qui-
                          etTime.End property for the campaign.

                        If any of the preceding conditions isn't met, the end-
                        point will receive messages from the campaign, even if
                        quiet time is enabled.

                        End -> (string)
                            The specific time when quiet time ends. This value
                            has  to  use 24-hour notation and be in HH:MM for-
                            mat, where HH is the hour (with a leading zero, if
                            applicable)  and  MM  is the minutes. For example,
                            use 02:30 to represent 2:30 AM, or 14:30 to repre-
                            sent 2:30 PM.

                        Start -> (string)
                            The  specific  time  when  quiet time begins. This
                            value has to use 24-hour notation and be in  HH:MM
                            format, where HH is the hour (with a leading zero,
                            if applicable) and MM is the minutes. For example,
                            use 02:30 to represent 2:30 AM, or 14:30 to repre-
                            sent 2:30 PM.

                     StartTime -> (string)
                        The scheduled time when the  campaign  began  or  will
                        begin.  Valid values are: IMMEDIATE, to start the cam-
                        paign immediately; or, a specific  time  in  ISO  8601
                        format.

                     Timezone -> (string)
                        The  starting UTC offset for the campaign schedule, if
                        the value of the IsLocalTime property is  true.  Valid
                        values  are:  UTC,  UTC+01, UTC+02, UTC+03, UTC+03:30,
                        UTC+04,  UTC+04:30,  UTC+05,   UTC+05:30,   UTC+05:45,

                            message. If specified, this value must  match  the
                            name of an existing message template.

                            reviewed and approved for use, depending  on  your
                            workflow.  It isn't necessarily the latest version

                            existing template version. To retrieve a  list  of
                            versions  and  version identifiers for a template,

                 single  endpoint during a 24-hour period. For an application,
                 this value specifies the default limit for the number of mes-
                 sages  that  campaigns and journeys can send to a single end-
                 point during a 24-hour period. The maximum value is 100.

                     fication  icon,  such  as a small version of the icon for
                     the app.

                 ImageUrl -> (string)

                     fication,  which is a push notification that doesn't dis-
                     play on a recipient's device. Silent  push  notifications

                     converted to an expiration value  when  it's  sent  to  a
                     push-notification  service.  If this value is 0, the ser-
                     vice treats the notification as if it expires immediately
                     and the service doesn't store or try to deliver the noti-
                     fication again.

                     This value  doesn't  apply  to  messages  that  are  sent

                     if  a  recipient taps the push notification and the value

                     messages that are critical or time-sensitive, such  as  a
                     one-time  passwords)  and PROMOTIONAL (for messsages that
                     aren't critical or time-sensitive, such as marketing mes-

                 OriginationNumber -> (string)

                     to  your AWS account. Although it isn't required, we rec-
                     ommend that you specify the long code using an E.164 for-
                     mat  to  ensure  prompt and accurate delivery of the mes-
                     sage. For example, +12065550100.

                                 included in the segment.

                               o AFTER - endpoints  with  attributes  read  as
                                 ISO_INSTANT  datetimes  after  the  value are
                                 included in the segment.

                               dimension.  Depending  on  the  value  of   the
                               AttributeType  property, endpoints are included
                               or excluded from the segment if their attribute
                               values match the criteria values.

                               (string)

                        sent or the journey activity to be performed. This can
                        be  a  standard  event that Amazon Pinpoint generates,
                        such as _email.delivered. For campaigns, this can also
                        be a custom event that's specific to your application.

                            sion.  Depending on the value of the DimensionType
                            property, endpoints are included or excluded  from
                            the  segment  if  their  values match the criteria
                            values.

                            (string)

                     Metrics -> (map)
                        One or  more  custom  metrics  that  your  application
                        reports  to Amazon Pinpoint. You can use these metrics
                        as selection criteria when you create an event filter.

                        key -> (string)

                            excluding endpoints from a segment. These criteria
                            derive  from  custom  metrics  that you define for
                            endpoints.

                            ComparisonOperator -> (string)

              Frequency -> (string)
                 Specifies how often the campaign is sent or whether the  cam-
                 paign is sent in response to a specific event.

              IsLocalTime -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  the  start and end times for the campaign
                 schedule use each recipient's local time. To base the  sched-
                 ule on each recipient's local time, set this value to true.

              QuietTime -> (structure)
                 The default quiet time for the campaign. Quiet time is a spe-
                 cific time range when a campaign  doesn't  send  messages  to
                 endpoints, if all the following conditions are met:

                 o The  EndpointDemographic.Timezone  property of the endpoint
                   is set to a valid value.

                 o The current time in the endpoint's time zone is later  than
                   or equal to the time specified by the QuietTime.Start prop-
                   erty for the campaign.

                 o The current time in the endpoint's  time  zone  is  earlier
                   than  or  equal  to the time specified by the QuietTime.End
                   property for the campaign.

                 If any of the preceding conditions isn't  met,  the  endpoint
                 will  receive  messages from the campaign, even if quiet time
                 is enabled.

                 End -> (string)
                     The specific time when quiet time ends. This value has to
                     use  24-hour notation and be in HH:MM format, where HH is
                     the hour (with a leading zero, if applicable) and  MM  is
                     the minutes. For example, use 02:30 to represent 2:30 AM,
                     or 14:30 to represent 2:30 PM.

                 Start -> (string)
                     The specific time when quiet time begins. This value  has
                     to  use 24-hour notation and be in HH:MM format, where HH
                     is the hour (with a leading zero, if applicable)  and  MM
                     is  the minutes. For example, use 02:30 to represent 2:30
                     AM, or 14:30 to represent 2:30 PM.

              StartTime -> (string)

                 The starting UTC offset for the  campaign  schedule,  if  the
                 value  of the IsLocalTime property is true. Valid values are:
                 UTC, UTC+01, UTC+02, UTC+03,  UTC+03:30,  UTC+04,  UTC+04:30,
                 UTC+05,  UTC+05:30,  UTC+05:45,  UTC+06,  UTC+06:30,  UTC+07,

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CampaignResponse -> (structure)
          Provides information about the status, configuration, and other set-
          tings for a campaign.

          AdditionalTreatments -> (list)
              An array of responses, one for each treatment that  you  defined
              for the campaign, in addition to the default treatment.

              (structure)
                 Specifies  the settings for a campaign treatment. A treatment
                 is a variation of a campaign that's used for A/B testing of a
                 campaign.

                 CustomDeliveryConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The  delivery  configuration  settings  for  sending  the
                     treatment  through  a  custom  channel.  This  object  is
                     required  if  the  MessageConfiguration  object  for  the
                     treatment specifies a CustomMessage object.

                     DeliveryUri -> (string)
                        The destination to send the campaign or treatment  to.

                        o The  name  or  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS
                          Lambda function to invoke to handle delivery of  the
                          campaign or treatment.

                        o The  URL  for a web application or service that sup-
                          ports HTTPS and can receive the message. The URL has
                          to be a full URL, including the HTTPS protocol.

                     EndpointTypes -> (list)
                        The  types of endpoints to send the campaign or treat-
                        ment to. Each valid value maps to a  type  of  channel
                        that  you  can associate with an endpoint by using the
                        ChannelType property of an endpoint.

                        (string)

                 Id -> (string)

                     ADMMessage -> (structure)
                        The message that the campaign sends  through  the  ADM
                        (Amazon  Device Messaging) channel. If specified, this
                        message overrides the default message.

                        Action -> (string)
                            The action to occur if a recipient taps  the  push
                            notification. Valid values are:

                            o OPEN_APP  -  Your  app  opens  or it becomes the
                              foreground app if it was sent to the background.
                              This is the default action.

                              Android.

                            o URL - The default mobile browser on the  recipi-
                              ent's  device  opens and loads the web page at a
                              URL that you specify.

                        Body -> (string)
                            The body of the notification message. The  maximum
                            number of characters is 200.

                        ImageIconUrl -> (string)
                            The  URL of the image to display as the push-noti-
                            fication icon, such as the icon for the app.

                        ImageSmallIconUrl -> (string)
                            The URL of the image  to  display  as  the  small,
                            push-notification icon, such as a small version of
                            the icon for the app.

                        ImageUrl -> (string)
                            The URL of an image to display in the push notifi-
                            cation.

                        JsonBody -> (string)
                            The  JSON payload to use for a silent push notifi-
                            cation.

                        MediaUrl -> (string)
                            The URL of the image or video to  display  in  the
                            push notification.

                            The  raw, JSON-formatted string to use as the pay-
                            load for the notification message.  If  specified,

                            message.

                        SilentPush -> (boolean)
                            Specifies whether the  notification  is  a  silent
                            push  notification,  which  is a push notification
                            that doesn't  display  on  a  recipient's  device.
                            Silent  push  notifications  can be used for cases
                            such as updating an app's configuration,  display-
                            ing  messages in an in-app message center, or sup-
                            porting phone home functionality.

                        TimeToLive -> (integer)
                            The number of seconds that  the  push-notification
                            service should keep the message, if the service is
                            unable to deliver the notification the first time.
                            This  value  is  converted  to an expiration value
                            when it's sent to a push-notification service.  If
                            this  value is 0, the service treats the notifica-
                            tion as if it expires immediately and the  service
                            doesn't  store  or try to deliver the notification
                            again.

                            This value doesn't apply to messages that are sent
                            through the Amazon Device Messaging (ADM) service.

                        Title -> (string)

                            sage on a recipient's device.

                        Url -> (string)
                            The  URL  to  open in a recipient's default mobile
                            browser, if a recipient taps the push notification
                            and the value of the Action property is URL.

                     APNSMessage -> (structure)
                        The  message  that the campaign sends through the APNs
                        (Apple Push Notification service) channel.  If  speci-
                        fied, this message overrides the default message.

                        Action -> (string)
                            The  action  to occur if a recipient taps the push
                            notification. Valid values are:

                            o OPEN_APP - Your app  opens  or  it  becomes  the
                              foreground app if it was sent to the background.
                              This is the default action.

                            o DEEP_LINK - Your app opens and displays a desig-
                              nated  user  interface  in the app. This setting
                              uses  the  deep-linking  features  of  iOS   and
                              Android.

                            o URL  - The default mobile browser on the recipi-

                            the icon for the app.

                        ImageUrl -> (string)

                            that doesn't  display  on  a  recipient's  device.
                            Silent  push  notifications  can be used for cases
                            such as updating an app's configuration,  display-

                            This  value  is  converted  to an expiration value
                            when it's sent to a push-notification service.  If
                            this  value is 0, the service treats the notifica-
                            tion as if it expires immediately and the  service
                            doesn't  store  or try to deliver the notification
                            again.

                            time-sensitive, such as marketing messages).

                                   AttributeType -> (string)
                                      The  type  of  segment dimension to use.
                                      Valid values are:

                                      o INCLUSIVE  -   endpoints   that   have
                                        attributes  matching  the  values  are
                                        included in the segment.

                                      o EXCLUSIVE  -   endpoints   that   have
                                        attributes  matching  the  values  are
                                        excluded in the segment.

                                      o CONTAINS   -   endpoints   that   have
                                        attributes'  substrings match the val-
                                        ues are included in the segment.

                                      o BEFORE  -  endpoints  with  attributes
                                        read  as  ISO_INSTANT datetimes before
                                        the value are included in the segment.

                                      o AFTER - endpoints with attributes read
                                        as  ISO_INSTANT  datetimes  after  the
                                        value are included in the segment.

                                      o ON - endpoints with attributes read as
                                        ISO_INSTANT dates  on  the  value  are
                                        included   in  the  segment.  Time  is
                                        ignored in this comparison.

                                      o BETWEEN -  endpoints  with  attributes
                                        read  as ISO_INSTANT datetimes between
                                        the values are included  in  the  seg-
                                        ment.

                                   Values -> (list)
                                      The  criteria values to use for the seg-
                                      ment dimension. Depending on  the  value
                                      of the AttributeType property, endpoints
                                      are included or excluded from  the  seg-
                                      ment if their attribute values match the
                                      criteria values.

                                      (string)

                            EventType -> (structure)
                               The name of the event that causes the  campaign
                               to  be  sent or the journey activity to be per-
                               formed. This can be a standard event that  Ama-
                               zon  Pinpoint  generates, such as _email.deliv-
                               ered. For campaigns, this can also be a  custom
                               event  that's specific to your application. For
                               information   about   standard   events,    see
                               Streaming  Amazon Pinpoint Events in the Amazon

                               DimensionType -> (string)
                                   The type of segment dimension to use. Valid
                                   values are: INCLUSIVE, endpoints that match
                                   the criteria are included in  the  segment;
                                   and,  EXCLUSIVE,  endpoints  that match the
                                   criteria are excluded from the segment.

                               Values -> (list)
                                   The criteria values to use for the  segment
                                   dimension.  Depending  on  the value of the
                                   DimensionType   property,   endpoints   are
                                   included  or  excluded  from the segment if
                                   their values match the criteria values.

                                   (string)

                            Metrics -> (map)
                               One or more custom metrics that  your  applica-
                               tion  reports  to  Amazon Pinpoint. You can use
                               these metrics as selection  criteria  when  you
                               create an event filter.

                               key -> (string)

                               value -> (structure)
                                   Specifies metric-based criteria for includ-
                                   ing or excluding endpoints from a  segment.
                                   These  criteria  derive from custom metrics
                                   that you define for endpoints.

                                   ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                      The operator to use when comparing  met-
                                      ric    values.    Valid    values   are:
                                      GREATER_THAN,                 LESS_THAN,
                                      GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL,
                                      LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL, and EQUAL.

                                   Value -> (double)
                                      The value to compare.

                        FilterType -> (string)
                            The type of event that causes the campaign  to  be
                            sent. Valid values are: SYSTEM, sends the campaign
                            when a system event occurs; and,  ENDPOINT,  sends
                            the  campaign  when  an  endpoint event (Eventsre-
                            source) occurs.

                     Frequency -> (string)
                        Specifies how often the campaign is  sent  or  whether
                        the  campaign is sent in response to a specific event.

                     IsLocalTime -> (boolean)
                        Specifies whether the start and end times for the cam-
                        paign  schedule  use  each  recipient's local time. To
                        base the schedule on each recipient's local time,  set
                        this value to true.

                     QuietTime -> (structure)
                        The default quiet time for the campaign. Quiet time is
                        a specific time range when  a  campaign  doesn't  send
                        messages to endpoints, if all the following conditions
                        are met:

                        o The  EndpointDemographic.Timezone  property  of  the
                          endpoint is set to a valid value.

                        o The  current  time  in  the  endpoint's time zone is
                          later than or equal to the  time  specified  by  the
                          QuietTime.Start property for the campaign.

                        o The current time in the endpoint's time zone is ear-
                          lier than or equal to the time specified by the Qui-
                          etTime.End property for the campaign.

                        If any of the preceding conditions isn't met, the end-
                        point will receive messages from the campaign, even if
                        quiet time is enabled.

                        End -> (string)
                            The specific time when quiet time ends. This value
                            has to use 24-hour notation and be in  HH:MM  for-
                            mat, where HH is the hour (with a leading zero, if
                            applicable) and MM is the  minutes.  For  example,
                            use 02:30 to represent 2:30 AM, or 14:30 to repre-
                            sent 2:30 PM.

                        Start -> (string)
                            The specific time when  quiet  time  begins.  This
                            value  has to use 24-hour notation and be in HH:MM
                            format, where HH is the hour (with a leading zero,
                            if applicable) and MM is the minutes. For example,
                            use 02:30 to represent 2:30 AM, or 14:30 to repre-
                            sent 2:30 PM.

                     StartTime -> (string)
                        The  scheduled  time  when  the campaign began or will
                        begin. Valid values are: IMMEDIATE, to start the  cam-
                        paign  immediately;  or,  a  specific time in ISO 8601
                        format.

                     Timezone -> (string)
                        The starting UTC offset for the campaign schedule,  if
                        the  value  of the IsLocalTime property is true. Valid
                        values are: UTC, UTC+01,  UTC+02,  UTC+03,  UTC+03:30,
                        UTC+04,   UTC+04:30,   UTC+05,  UTC+05:30,  UTC+05:45,
                        UTC+06, UTC+06:30, UTC+07, UTC+08, UTC+09,  UTC+09:30,
                        UTC+10,  UTC+10:30,  UTC+11,  UTC+12,  UTC+13, UTC-02,
                        UTC-03,  UTC-04,  UTC-05,  UTC-06,   UTC-07,   UTC-08,
                        UTC-09, UTC-10, and UTC-11.

                 SizePercent -> (integer)
                     The  allocated percentage of users (segment members) that
                     the treatment is sent to.

                 State -> (structure)
                     The current status of the treatment.

                     CampaignStatus -> (string)
                        The current status of the  campaign,  or  the  current
                        status of a treatment that belongs to an A/B test cam-
                        paign.

                        If a campaign uses A/B testing,  the  campaign  has  a
                        status  of  COMPLETED  only if all campaign treatments
                        have a status of COMPLETED. If you delete the  segment
                        that's  associated with a campaign, the campaign fails
                        and has a status of DELETED.

                 TemplateConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The message template to use for the treatment.

                     EmailTemplate -> (structure)
                        The email template to use for the message.

                            The name of the message template to  use  for  the
                            message.  If  specified, this value must match the
                            name of an existing message template.

                        Version -> (string)
                            The unique identifier for the version of the  mes-
                            sage  template  to  use for the message. If speci-
                            fied, this value must match the identifier for  an
                            existing  template  version. To retrieve a list of
                            versions and version identifiers for  a  template,
                            use the Template Versionsresource.

                            If  you  don't  specify a value for this property,
                            Amazon Pinpoint uses the  active  version  of  the
                            template. The active version is typically the ver-
                            sion of  a  template  that's  been  most  recently
                            reviewed  and  approved for use, depending on your
                            workflow. It isn't necessarily the latest  version
                            of a template.

                     PushTemplate -> (structure)
                        The push notification template to use for the message.

                            The name of the message template to  use  for  the
                            message.  If  specified, this value must match the
                            name of an existing message template.

                        Version -> (string)
                            The unique identifier for the version of the  mes-
                            sage  template  to  use for the message. If speci-
                            fied, this value must match the identifier for  an
                            existing  template  version. To retrieve a list of
                            versions and version identifiers for  a  template,
                            use the Template Versionsresource.

                            If  you  don't  specify a value for this property,
                            Amazon Pinpoint uses the  active  version  of  the
                            template. The active version is typically the ver-
                            sion of  a  template  that's  been  most  recently
                            reviewed  and  approved for use, depending on your
                            workflow. It isn't necessarily the latest  version
                            of a template.

                     SMSTemplate -> (structure)

                        Name -> (string)
                            The  name  of  the message template to use for the
                            message. If specified, this value must  match  the
                            name of an existing message template.

                            The  unique identifier for the version of the mes-
                            sage template to use for the  message.  If  speci-
                            fied,  this value must match the identifier for an
                            existing template version. To retrieve a  list  of

                            template. The active version is typically the ver-
                            sion  of  a  template  that's  been  most recently
                            reviewed and approved for use, depending  on  your
                            workflow.  It isn't necessarily the latest version

                            message. If specified, this value must  match  the
                            name of an existing message template.

                        Version -> (string)
                            The  unique identifier for the version of the mes-
                            sage template to use for the  message.  If  speci-
                            fied,  this value must match the identifier for an
                            existing template version. To retrieve a  list  of
                            versions  and  version identifiers for a template,
                            use the Template Versionsresource.

                            If you don't specify a value  for  this  property,
                            Amazon  Pinpoint  uses  the  active version of the
                            template. The active version is typically the ver-
                            sion  of  a  template  that's  been  most recently
                            reviewed and approved for use, depending  on  your
                            workflow.  It isn't necessarily the latest version

                 COMPLETED only if all campaign treatments have  a  status  of
                 COMPLETED. If you delete the segment that's associated with a

                                 ISO_INSTANT datetimes  after  the  value  are
                                 included in the segment.

                               dimension.   Depending  on  the  value  of  the
                               AttributeType property, endpoints are  included
                               or excluded from the segment if their attribute
                               values match the criteria values.

                        sent or the journey activity to be performed. This can
                        be a standard event that  Amazon  Pinpoint  generates,
                        such as _email.delivered. For campaigns, this can also
                        be a custom event that's specific to your application.

                            are: INCLUSIVE, endpoints that match the  criteria
                            are  included in the segment; and, EXCLUSIVE, end-
                            points that match the criteria are  excluded  from
                            the segment.

                            sion. Depending on the value of the  DimensionType
                            property,  endpoints are included or excluded from
                            the segment if their  values  match  the  criteria
                            values.

                        reports to Amazon Pinpoint. You can use these  metrics
                        as selection criteria when you create an event filter.

                        key -> (string)

                            excluding endpoints from a segment. These criteria
                            derive from custom metrics  that  you  define  for
                            endpoints.

                            ComparisonOperator -> (string)

              Frequency -> (string)
                 Specifies  how often the campaign is sent or whether the cam-
                 paign is sent in response to a specific event.

                 Specifies whether the start and end times  for  the  campaign
                 schedule  use each recipient's local time. To base the sched-
                 ule on each recipient's local time, set this value to true.

              QuietTime -> (structure)
                 The default quiet time for the campaign. Quiet time is a spe-
                 cific  time  range  when  a campaign doesn't send messages to
                 endpoints, if all the following conditions are met:

                 o The EndpointDemographic.Timezone property of  the  endpoint
                   is set to a valid value.

                 o The  current time in the endpoint's time zone is later than
                   or equal to the time specified by the QuietTime.Start prop-
                   erty for the campaign.

                 o The  current  time  in  the endpoint's time zone is earlier
                   than or equal to the time specified  by  the  QuietTime.End
                   property for the campaign.

                 If  any  of  the preceding conditions isn't met, the endpoint
                 will receive messages from the campaign, even if  quiet  time
                 is enabled.

                 End -> (string)
                     The specific time when quiet time ends. This value has to
                     use 24-hour notation and be in HH:MM format, where HH  is
                     the  hour  (with a leading zero, if applicable) and MM is
                     the minutes. For example, use 02:30 to represent 2:30 AM,
                     or 14:30 to represent 2:30 PM.

                 Start -> (string)
                     The  specific time when quiet time begins. This value has
                     to use 24-hour notation and be in HH:MM format, where  HH
                     is  the  hour (with a leading zero, if applicable) and MM
                     is the minutes. For example, use 02:30 to represent  2:30
                     AM, or 14:30 to represent 2:30 PM.

              StartTime -> (string)
