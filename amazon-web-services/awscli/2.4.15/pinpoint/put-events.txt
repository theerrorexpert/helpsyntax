       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-events
          --application-id <value>
          --events-request <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --events-request (structure)
          Specifies a batch of events to process.

          BatchItem -> (map)
              The  batch  of  events to process. For each item in a batch, the
              endpoint ID acts as a key that has an EventsBatch object as  its
              value.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)

                        point by associating a name with an array  of  values.
                        You  can  use these attributes as filter criteria when
                        you create segments.

                        Specifies whether to send messages or  push  notifica-
                        tions  to the endpoint. Valid values are: ACTIVE, mes-

                        sages arent sent to the endpoint.

                        Amazon  Pinpoint  automatically  sets  this  value  to
                        ACTIVE when you create an endpoint or update an exist-
                        ing  endpoint. Amazon Pinpoint automatically sets this
                        value to INACTIVE if you update another endpoint  that
                        has  the  same  address specified by the Address prop-

                            is located. For example, US for the United States.

                     Metrics -> (map)
                        One  or  more  custom metrics that your app reports to

                        A unique identifier that's  generated  each  time  the
                        endpoint is updated.

                     User -> (structure)
                        One  or  more  custom  user  attributes  that your app
                        reports to Amazon Pinpoint for the user who's  associ-
                        ated with the endpoint.

                        UserAttributes -> (map)
                            One  or  more  custom attributes that describe the
                            user by associating a name with an array  of  val-
                            ues.  For example, the value of an attribute named
                            Interests   might   be:    ["Science",    "Music",
                            "Travel"].  You can use these attributes as filter
                            criteria when you create segments. Attribute names
                            are case sensitive.

                            An attribute name can contain up to 50 characters.
                            An attribute value can contain up to  100  charac-
                            ters.  When  you  define  the  name  of  a  custom
                            attribute, avoid using the  following  characters:
                            number  sign  (#),  colon  (:), question mark (?),
                            backslash (), and slash (/). The  Amazon  Pinpoint
                            console can't display attribute names that contain
                            these characters. This restriction  doesn't  apply
                            to attribute values.

       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EventsResponse -> (structure)
          Provides information about endpoints and  the  events  that  they're
          associated with.

          Results -> (map)
              A  map that contains a multipart response for each endpoint. For
              each item in this object, the endpoint ID is  the  key  and  the
              item  response  is  the  value.  If no item response exists, the
              value can also be one of the following:  202,  the  request  was
              processed  successfully;  or  400,  the  payload wasn't valid or
              required fields were missing.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Provides information about the results of a request to create
                 or update an endpoint that's associated with an event.

                 EndpointItemResponse -> (structure)
                     The  response  that  was received after the endpoint data
                     was accepted.

                     Message -> (string)
                        The custom message that's returned in the response  as
                        a result of processing the endpoint data.

                     StatusCode -> (integer)
                        The  status  code that's returned in the response as a
                        result of processing the endpoint data.

                 EventsItemResponse -> (map)
                     A multipart response object that contains  a  key  and  a
                     value  for each event in the request. In each object, the
                     event ID is the key and an  EventItemResponse  object  is
                     the value.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Provides  the status code and message that result from
                        processing an event.

                        Message -> (string)
                            A custom message that's returned in  the  response
                            as a result of processing the event.

                        StatusCode -> (integer)
                            The status code that's returned in the response as
                            a result of processing the event. Possible  values
                            are: 202, for events that were accepted; and, 400,
                            for events that weren't valid.
