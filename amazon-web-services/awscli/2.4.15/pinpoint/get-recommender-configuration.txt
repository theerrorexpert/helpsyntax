NAME
       get-recommender-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about an Amazon Pinpoint configuration for a rec-
       ommender model.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-recommender-configuration
          --recommender-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --recommender-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the recommender model configuration.  This
          identifier is displayed as the Recommender ID on the Amazon Pinpoint
          console.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RecommenderConfigurationResponse -> (structure)
          Provides information about Amazon  Pinpoint  configuration  settings
          for retrieving and processing data from a recommender model.

          Attributes -> (map)
              A  map  that  defines  1-10  custom endpoint or user attributes,
              depending on  the  value  for  the  RecommendationProviderIdType
              property.  Each  of these attributes temporarily stores a recom-
              mended item that's retrieved from the recommender model and sent
              to  an  AWS  Lambda  function  for  additional  processing. Each
              attribute can be used as a message variable in  a  message  tem-
              plate.

              This  value  is  null if the configuration doesn't invoke an AWS
              Lambda function (RecommendationTransformerUri) to perform  addi-
              tional processing of recommendation data.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          CreationDate -> (string)
              The  date,  in  extended ISO 8601 format, when the configuration
              was created for the recommender model.

          Description -> (string)
              The custom description of the configuration for the  recommender
              model.

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the recommender model configuration.

          LastModifiedDate -> (string)
              The  date,  in  extended ISO 8601 format, when the configuration
              for the recommender model was last modified.

          Name -> (string)
              The custom name of the configuration for the recommender  model.

          RecommendationProviderIdType -> (string)
              The  type  of  Amazon  Pinpoint ID that's associated with unique
              user IDs in the recommender model. This value enables the  model
              to  use  attribute and event data thats specific to a particular
              endpoint or user in an  Amazon  Pinpoint  application.  Possible
              values are:

              o PINPOINT_ENDPOINT_ID  -  Each  user in the model is associated
                with a particular endpoint in Amazon  Pinpoint.  The  data  is
                correlated  based  on endpoint IDs in Amazon Pinpoint. This is
                the default value.

              o PINPOINT_USER_ID - Each user in the model is associated with a
                particular  user  and endpoint in Amazon Pinpoint. The data is
                correlated based on user IDs in Amazon Pinpoint. If this value
                is specified, an endpoint definition in Amazon Pinpoint has to
                specify both a user ID (UserId) and an endpoint ID. Otherwise,
                messages wont be sent to the user's endpoint.

          RecommendationProviderRoleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access
              Management  (IAM)  role  that  authorizes  Amazon  Pinpoint   to
              retrieve recommendation data from the recommender model.

          RecommendationProviderUri -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the recommender model that
              Amazon Pinpoint retrieves the  recommendation  data  from.  This
              value is the ARN of an Amazon Personalize campaign.

          RecommendationTransformerUri -> (string)
              The  name  or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Lambda func-
              tion that Amazon Pinpoint invokes to perform additional process-
              ing  of  recommendation  data  that it retrieves from the recom-
              mender model.

          RecommendationsDisplayName -> (string)
              The custom display  name  for  the  standard  endpoint  or  user
              attribute  (RecommendationItems)  that temporarily stores recom-
              mended items for each endpoint or user, depending on  the  value
              for the RecommendationProviderIdType property. This name appears
              in the Attribute finder of the template  editor  on  the  Amazon
              Pinpoint console.

              This  value  is  null if the configuration doesn't invoke an AWS
              Lambda function (RecommendationTransformerUri) to perform  addi-
              tional processing of recommendation data.

          RecommendationsPerMessage -> (integer)
              The  number  of  recommended  items  that are retrieved from the
              model for each endpoint or user, depending on the value for  the
              RecommendationProviderIdType  property.  This  number determines
              how many recommended items are  available  for  use  in  message
              variables.
