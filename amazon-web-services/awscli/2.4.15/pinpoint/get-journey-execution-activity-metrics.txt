NAME
       get-journey-execution-activity-metrics -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves (queries) pre-aggregated data for a standard execution metric
       that applies to a journey activity.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-journey-execution-activity-metrics
          --application-id <value>
          --journey-activity-id <value>
          --journey-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --journey-activity-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the journey activity.

       --journey-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the journey.

       --next-token (string)
          The string that specifies which page of results to return in a pagi-
          nated response. This parameter is  not  supported  for  application,
          campaign, and journey metrics.

       --page-size (string)
          The  maximum  number of items to include in each page of a paginated
          response. This parameter is not supported for application, campaign,
          and journey metrics.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       JourneyExecutionActivityMetricsResponse -> (structure)
          Provides  the results of a query that retrieved the data for a stan-
          dard execution metric that applies to a journey activity,  and  pro-
          vides information about that query.

          ActivityType -> (string)
              The type of activity that the metric applies to. Possible values
              are:

              o CONDITIONAL_SPLIT - For a yes/no split activity, which  is  an
                activity  that  sends  participants down one of two paths in a
                journey.

              o HOLDOUT - For a holdout activity, which is  an  activity  that
                stops a journey for a specified percentage of participants.

              o MESSAGE  -  For  an  email activity, which is an activity that
                sends an email message to participants.

              o MULTI_CONDITIONAL_SPLIT - For a multivariate  split  activity,
                which  is  an  activity that sends participants down one of as
                many as five paths in a journey.

              o RANDOM_SPLIT - For a random split activity, which is an activ-
                ity  that sends specified percentages of participants down one
                of as many as five paths in a journey.

              o WAIT - For a wait activity, which is an  activity  that  waits
                for a certain amount of time or until a specific date and time
                before moving participants to the next activity in a  journey.

          ApplicationId -> (string)
              The  unique  identifier  for  the  application  that  the metric
              applies to.

          JourneyActivityId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the activity that the  metric  applies
              to.

          JourneyId -> (string)
              The  unique  identifier  for the journey that the metric applies
              to.

          LastEvaluatedTime -> (string)
              The date and time, in ISO 8601 format, when Amazon Pinpoint last
              evaluated  the  execution status of the activity and updated the
              data for the metric.

          Metrics -> (map)
              A JSON object that  contains  the  results  of  the  query.  The
              results  vary  depending on the type of activity (ActivityType).
              For information about the structure and contents of the results,
              see the Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide .

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)
