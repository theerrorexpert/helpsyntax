NAME
       delete-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an endpoint from an application.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-endpoint
          --application-id <value>
          --endpoint-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier for the application. This identifier is dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --endpoint-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the endpoint.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EndpointResponse -> (structure)
          Provides information about the channel type and other  settings  for
          an endpoint.

          Address -> (string)
              The  destination address for messages or push notifications that
              you send to the endpoint. The address  varies  by  channel.  For
              example,  the  address  for a push-notification channel is typi-
              cally the token provided by a push notification service, such as
              an  Apple  Push  Notification  service  (APNs) device token or a
              Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) registration token.  The  address
              for  the  SMS channel is a phone number in E.164 format, such as
              +12065550100. The address for the  email  channel  is  an  email
              address.

          ApplicationId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the application that's associated with
              the endpoint.

          Attributes -> (map)
              One or more custom attributes  that  describe  the  endpoint  by
              associating  a  name  with  an array of values. For example, the
              value of a custom attribute named  Interests  might  be:  ["Sci-
              ence",  "Music", "Travel"]. You can use these attributes as fil-
              ter criteria when you create segments.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (list)

              tions to the endpoint.

          CohortId -> (string)
              A  number from 0-99 that represents the cohort that the endpoint
              is assigned to. Endpoints are grouped into cohorts randomly, and
              each  cohort  contains  approximately 1 percent of the endpoints
              for an application. Amazon Pinpoint assigns cohorts to the hold-
              out or treatment allocations for campaigns.

          CreationDate -> (string)
              The  date  and  time,  in ISO 8601 format, when the endpoint was
              created.

          Demographic -> (structure)
              The demographic information for the endpoint, such as  the  time
              zone and platform.

              AppVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the app that's associated with the endpoint.

              Locale -> (string)
                 The  locale of the endpoint, in the following format: the ISO
                 639-1 alpha-2 code, followed by an underscore  (_),  followed
                 by an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 value.

                 iPhone or SM-G900F.

              ModelVersion -> (string)
                 The model version of the endpoint device.

              Platform -> (string)

          EffectiveDate -> (string)
              The date and time, in ISO 8601 format,  when  the  endpoint  was
              last updated.

          EndpointStatus -> (string)
              Specifies whether messages or push notifications are sent to the
              endpoint. Possible values are: ACTIVE, messages are sent to  the
              endpoint; and, INACTIVE, messages arent sent to the endpoint.

              Amazon Pinpoint automatically sets this value to ACTIVE when you
              create an endpoint or update an existing endpoint.  Amazon  Pin-
              point  automatically  sets  this value to INACTIVE if you update
              another endpoint that has the  same  address  specified  by  the
              Address property.

          Id -> (string)
              The  unique  identifier  that  you assigned to the endpoint. The
              identifier should be a  globally  unique  identifier  (GUID)  to
              ensure  that it doesn't conflict with other endpoint identifiers
              that are associated with the application.

          Location -> (structure)
              The geographic information for the endpoint.

                 country or region where the endpoint is located. For example,
                 US for the United States.

              Latitude -> (double)
                 The latitude coordinate of the endpoint location, rounded  to
                 one decimal place.

              Longitude -> (double)
                 The longitude coordinate of the endpoint location, rounded to
                 one decimal place.

              PostalCode -> (string)
                 The postal or ZIP code for the area  where  the  endpoint  is

              Region -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  region where the endpoint is located. For
                 locations in the United States, this value is the name  of  a
                 state.

          Metrics -> (map)
              One  or more custom metrics that your app reports to Amazon Pin-
              point for the endpoint.

              value -> (double)

          OptOut -> (string)
              Specifies whether the user who's associated  with  the  endpoint
              has  opted out of receiving messages and push notifications from
              you. Possible values are:  ALL,  the  user  has  opted  out  and
              doesn't want to receive any messages or push notifications; and,
              NONE, the user hasn't opted out and wants to  receive  all  mes-
              sages and push notifications.

          RequestId -> (string)
              The  unique identifier for the most recent request to update the
              endpoint.

          User -> (structure)
              One or more custom user attributes that your app reports to Ama-
              zon Pinpoint for the user who's associated with the endpoint.

              UserAttributes -> (map)
                 One or more custom attributes that describe the user by asso-
                 ciating a name with an array  of  values.  For  example,  the
                 value  of  an attribute named Interests might be: ["Science",
                 "Music", "Travel"]. You can use these  attributes  as  filter
                 criteria  when  you create segments. Attribute names are case
                 sensitive.

                 An attribute  name  can  contain  up  to  50  characters.  An
                 attribute  value  can  contain up to 100 characters. When you
                 define the name of a custom attribute, avoid using  the  fol-
                 lowing  characters: number sign (#), colon (:), question mark
                 (?), backslash (), and slash (/). The Amazon Pinpoint console
                 can't  display attribute names that contain these characters.
                 This restriction doesn't apply to attribute values.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (list)
                     (string)

              UserId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the user.
