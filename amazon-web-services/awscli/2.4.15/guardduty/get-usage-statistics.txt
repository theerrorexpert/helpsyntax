GET-USAGE-STATISTICS()                                  GET-USAGE-STATISTICS()



NAME
       get-usage-statistics -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  Amazon  GuardDuty usage statistics over the last 30 days for the
       specified detector ID. For newly enabled detectors or data sources  the
       cost  returned  will  include only the usage so far under 30 days, this
       may differ from the cost metrics in the console, which  projects  usage
       over  30  days to provide a monthly cost estimate. For more information
       see Understanding How Usage Costs are Calculated .

OPTIONS
       --detector-id (string)
          The ID of the detector that specifies the  GuardDuty  service  whose
          usage statistics you want to retrieve.

       --usage-statistic-type (string)
          The type of usage statistics to retrieve.

          Possible values:

          o SUM_BY_ACCOUNT

          o SUM_BY_DATA_SOURCE

          o SUM_BY_RESOURCE

          o TOP_RESOURCES

       --usage-criteria (structure)
          Represents the criteria used for querying usage.

          AccountIds -> (list)
              The account IDs to aggregate usage statistics from.

              (string)

          DataSources -> (list)
              The data sources to aggregate usage statistics from.

              (string)

          Resources -> (list)
              The  resources  to aggregate usage statistics from. Only accepts
              exact resource names.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccountIds=string,string,DataSources=string,string,Resources=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AccountIds": ["string", ...],
            "DataSources": ["FLOW_LOGS"|"CLOUD_TRAIL"|"DNS_LOGS"|"S3_LOGS"|"KUBERNETES_AUDIT_LOGS", ...],
            "Resources": ["string", ...]
          }

       --unit (string)
          The currency unit you would like to view your usage  statistics  in.
          Current valid values are USD.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in the response.

       --next-token (string)
          A  token  to  use  for  paginating  results that are returned in the
          response. Set the value of this parameter  to  null  for  the  first
          request  to  a  list action. For subsequent calls, use the NextToken
          value returned from the previous request to continue listing results
          after the first page.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
