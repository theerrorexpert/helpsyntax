NAME
       guardduty -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that ana-
       lyzes and processes the following data sources: VPC Flow  Logs,  Amazon
       Web Services CloudTrail event logs, and DNS logs. It uses threat intel-
       ligence feeds (such as lists of malicious IPs and domains) and  machine
       learning  to  identify  unexpected, potentially unauthorized, and mali-
       cious activity within your Amazon Web Services  environment.  This  can
       include  issues like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed creden-
       tials, or communication with malicious IPs, URLs, or domains. For exam-
       ple,  GuardDuty can detect compromised EC2 instances that serve malware
       or mine bitcoin.

       GuardDuty also monitors Amazon Web Services account access behavior for
       signs of compromise. Some examples of this are unauthorized infrastruc-
       ture deployments such as EC2 instances deployed in a  Region  that  has
       never  been used, or unusual API calls like a password policy change to
       reduce password strength.

       GuardDuty informs you of the status of your Amazon Web  Services  envi-
       ronment  by producing security findings that you can view in the Guard-
       Duty console or through Amazon CloudWatch events. For more information,
       see the * Amazon GuardDuty User Guide * .
