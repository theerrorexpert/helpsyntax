SYNOPSIS
            invite-members
          --detector-id <value>
          --account-ids <value>
          [--disable-email-notification | --no-disable-email-notification]
          [--message <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --detector-id (string)
          The unique ID of the detector of the GuardDuty account that you want
          to invite members with.

       --account-ids (list)
          A list of account IDs of the accounts that you  want  to  invite  to
          GuardDuty as members.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --disable-email-notification      |     --no-disable-email-notification
       (boolean)
          A Boolean value that specifies whether you  want  to  disable  email
          notification  to  the accounts that you are inviting to GuardDuty as
          members.

       --message (string)
          The invitation message that you want to send to  the  accounts  that
          you're inviting to GuardDuty as members.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       UnprocessedAccounts -> (list)
          A  list of objects that contain the unprocessed account and a result
          string that explains why it was unprocessed.

          (structure)
              Contains information about the accounts that weren't  processed.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID.

              Result -> (string)
                 A reason why the account hasn't been processed.
