NAME
       get-findings -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes Amazon GuardDuty findings specified by finding IDs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-findings
          --detector-id <value>
          --finding-ids <value>
          [--sort-criteria <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --detector-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the detector that specifies the GuardDuty service whose
          findings you want to retrieve.

       --finding-ids (list)
          The IDs of the findings that you want to retrieve.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --sort-criteria (structure)
          Represents the criteria used for sorting findings.

          AttributeName -> (string)
              Represents the finding attribute  (for  example,  accountId)  to
              sort findings by.

          OrderBy -> (string)
              The order by which the sorted findings are to be displayed.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AttributeName=string,OrderBy=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AttributeName": "string",
            "OrderBy": "ASC"|"DESC"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To retrieve the details of a specific finding

       The  following  get-findings  example  retrieves  the full JSON finding
       details of the specified finding.
