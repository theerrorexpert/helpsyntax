       --data-sources (structure)
          Describes which data sources will be updated.

          S3Logs -> (structure)
              Describes  whether  S3  data  event  logs  are enabled as a data
              source.

              Enable -> (boolean)
                 The status of S3 data event logs as a data source.

          Kubernetes -> (structure)
              Describes whether  any  Kubernetes  logs  are  enabled  as  data
              sources.

              AuditLogs -> (structure)
                 The status of Kubernetes audit logs as a data source.

                 Enable -> (boolean)
                     The status of Kubernetes audit logs as a data source.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Logs={Enable=boolean},Kubernetes={AuditLogs={Enable=boolean}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Logs": {
              "Enable": true|false
            },
            "Kubernetes": {
              "AuditLogs": {
                "Enable": true|false
              }
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       UnprocessedAccounts -> (list)
          A  list of member account IDs that were unable to be processed along
          with an explanation for why they were not processed.

          (structure)
              Contains information about the accounts that weren't  processed.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID.

              Result -> (string)
                 A reason why the account hasn't been processed.
