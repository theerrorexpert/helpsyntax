CREATE-MEMBERS()                                              CREATE-MEMBERS()



NAME
       create-members -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  member  accounts of the current Amazon Web Services account by
       specifying a list of Amazon Web Services account IDs. This  step  is  a
       prerequisite  for  managing  the  associated  member accounts either by
       invitation or through an organization.

       When using Create Members as an organizations  delegated  administrator
       this  action  will  enable GuardDuty in the added member accounts, with
       the exception of  the  organization  delegated  administrator  account,
       which must enable GuardDuty prior to being added as a member.

       If  you  are adding accounts by invitation use this action after Guard-
       Duty has been enabled in potential member accounts and before  using  `
       Invite                                                          Members

SYNOPSIS
            create-members
          --detector-id <value>
          --account-details <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --detector-id (string)
          The unique ID of the detector of the GuardDuty account that you want
          to associate member accounts with.

       --account-details (list)
          A list of account ID and email address pairs of  the  accounts  that
          you want to associate with the GuardDuty administrator account.

          (structure)
              Contains information about the account.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The member account ID.

              Email -> (string)
                 The email address of the member account.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccountId=string,Email=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "AccountId": "string",
              "Email": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
