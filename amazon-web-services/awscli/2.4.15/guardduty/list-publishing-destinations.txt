DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of publishing destinations associated with the specified
       detectorId .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-publishing-destinations
          --detector-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --detector-id (string)
          The ID of the detector to retrieve publishing destinations for.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in the response.

       --next-token (string)
          A token to use for paginating  results  that  are  returned  in  the
          response.  Set  the  value  of  this parameter to null for the first
          request to a list action. For subsequent calls,  use  the  NextToken
          value returned from the previous request to continue listing results
          after the first page.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  to  use  for  paginating  results that are returned in the
