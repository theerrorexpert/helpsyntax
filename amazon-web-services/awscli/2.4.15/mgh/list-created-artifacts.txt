LIST-CREATED-ARTIFACTS()                              LIST-CREATED-ARTIFACTS()



NAME
       list-created-artifacts -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  created  artifacts attached to a given migration task in an
       update stream. This API has the following traits:

       o Gets the list of the created  artifacts  while  migration  is  taking
         place.

       o Shows the artifacts created by the migration tool that was associated
         by the AssociateCreatedArtifact API.

       o Lists created artifacts in a paginated interface.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-created-artifacts is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: CreatedArtifactList

SYNOPSIS
            list-created-artifacts
          --progress-update-stream <value>
          --migration-task-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --progress-update-stream (string)
          The name of the ProgressUpdateStream.

       --migration-task-name (string)
          Unique  identifier  that references the migration task. Do not store
          personal data in this field.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If  there are more created artifacts than the max result, return the
          next token to be passed to the next call as a bookmark of  where  to
          start from.

       CreatedArtifactList -> (list)
          List of created artifacts up to the maximum number of results speci-
          fied in the request.

          (structure)
              An ARN of the AWS cloud resource target receiving the  migration
              (e.g., AMI, EC2 instance, RDS instance, etc.).

              Name -> (string)
                 An  ARN  that  uniquely  identifies the result of a migration
                 task.

              Description -> (string)
                 A description that can be free-form text to record additional
                 detail about the artifact for clarity or for later reference.
