LIST-MIGRATION-TASKS()                                  LIST-MIGRATION-TASKS()



NAME
       list-migration-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all,  or  filtered  by resource name, migration tasks associated
       with the user account making this call.  This  API  has  the  following
       traits:

       o Can show a summary list of the most recent migration tasks.

       o Can  show  a  summary list of migration tasks associated with a given
         discovered resource.

       o Lists migration tasks in a paginated interface.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-migration-tasks is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: MigrationTaskSummaryList

SYNOPSIS
            list-migration-tasks
          [--resource-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-name (string)
          Filter migration tasks by discovered resource name.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If there are more migration tasks than the max  result,  return  the
          next  token  to be passed to the next call as a bookmark of where to
          start from.

       MigrationTaskSummaryList -> (list)
          Lists the migration task's summary which includes: MigrationTaskName
          ,  ProgressPercent , ProgressUpdateStream , Status , and the Update-
          DateTime for each task.

          (structure)
              MigrationTaskSummary includes MigrationTaskName  ,  ProgressPer-
              cent  ,  ProgressUpdateStream  , Status , and UpdateDateTime for
              each task.

              ProgressUpdateStream -> (string)
                 An AWS resource used for access control. It  should  uniquely
                 identify  the  migration  tool  as it is used for all updates
                 made by the tool.

              MigrationTaskName -> (string)
                 Unique identifier that references the migration task. Do  not
                 store personal data in this field.

              Status -> (string)
                 Status of the task.

              ProgressPercent -> (integer)
                 Indication of the percentage completion of the task.

              StatusDetail -> (string)
                 Detail  information  of what is being done within the overall
                 status state.

              UpdateDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp when the task was gathered.
