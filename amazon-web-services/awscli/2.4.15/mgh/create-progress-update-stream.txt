CREATE-PROGRESS-UPDATE-STREAM()                CREATE-PROGRESS-UPDATE-STREAM()



NAME
       create-progress-update-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  progress  update  stream  which is an AWS resource used for
       access control as well as a namespace for migration task names that  is
       implicitly  linked  to  your AWS account. It must uniquely identify the
       migration tool as it is used for all updates made by the tool; however,
       it does not need to be unique for each AWS account because it is scoped
       to the AWS account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-progress-update-stream
          --progress-update-stream-name <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --progress-update-stream-name (string)
          The name of the ProgressUpdateStream. Do not store personal data  in
          this field.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Optional  boolean  flag  to  indicate whether any effect should take
          place. Used to test if the caller has permission to make the call.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
