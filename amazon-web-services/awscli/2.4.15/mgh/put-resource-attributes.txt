PUT-RESOURCE-ATTRIBUTES()                            PUT-RESOURCE-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       put-resource-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  identifying details of the resource being migrated so that it
       can be associated in the Application Discovery Service repository. This
       association  occurs asynchronously after PutResourceAttributes returns.

       WARNING:

          o Keep in mind that subsequent calls to  PutResourceAttributes  will
            override previously stored attributes. For example, if it is first
            called with a MAC address, but later, it is desired to add  an  IP
            address,  it will then be required to call it with both the IP and
            MAC addresses to prevent overriding the MAC address.

          o Note the instructions regarding the special  use  case  of  the  `
            ResourceAttributeList
            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub/latest/ug/API_PutResourceAttributes.html#migrationhub-PutResourceAttributes-request-ResourceAttributeList`__
            parameter when specifying any "VM" related value.

       NOTE:
          Because  this  is  an  asynchronous call, it will always return 200,
          whether an association occurs or not. To confirm if  an  association
          was  found  based  on  the  provided  details,  call  ListDiscovere-
          dResources .

SYNOPSIS
            put-resource-attributes
          --progress-update-stream <value>
          --migration-task-name <value>
          --resource-attribute-list <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --progress-update-stream (string)
          The name of the ProgressUpdateStream.

       --migration-task-name (string)
          Unique identifier that references the migration task. Do  not  store
          personal data in this field.

       --resource-attribute-list (list)
          Information  about  the  resource  that is being migrated. This data
          will be used to map the task to a resource in the  Application  Dis-
          covery Service repository.

          NOTE:
              Takes the object array of ResourceAttribute where the Type field
              is  reserved  for   the   following   values:   IPV4_ADDRESS   |
              IPV6_ADDRESS  |  MAC_ADDRESS  |  FQDN  | VM_MANAGER_ID | VM_MAN-
              AGED_OBJECT_REFERENCE | VM_NAME | VM_PATH |  BIOS_ID  |  MOTHER-
              BOARD_SERIAL_NUMBER  where the identifying value can be a string
              up to 256 characters.

          WARNING:

              o If any "VM" related  value  is  set  for  a  ResourceAttribute
                object,  it  is required that VM_MANAGER_ID , as a minimum, is
                always set. If VM_MANAGER_ID is not set, then all "VM"  fields
                will  be discarded and "VM" fields will not be used for match-
                ing the migration task to a server  in  Application  Discovery
                Service  repository.  See  the Example section below for a use
                case of specifying "VM" related values.

              o If a server you are trying to match has  multiple  IP  or  MAC
                addresses,  you should provide as many as you know in separate
                type/value pairs passed to the ResourceAttributeList parameter
                to maximize the chances of matching.

          (structure)
              Attribute associated with a resource.

              Note the corresponding format required per type listed below:
                     IPV4

                 x.x.x.x

                 where x is an integer in the range [0,255]
                     IPV6

                 y : y : y : y : y : y : y : y

                 where y is a hexadecimal between 0 and FFFF. [0, FFFF]
                     MAC_ADDRESS

                 ^([0-9A-Fa-f]{2}[:-]){5}([0-9A-Fa-f]{2})$
                     FQDN

                 ^[^<>{}\\\\/?,=\\p{Cntrl}]{1,256}$

              Type -> (string)
                 Type of resource.

              Value -> (string)
                 Value of the resource type.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Type": "IPV4_ADDRESS"|"IPV6_ADDRESS"|"MAC_ADDRESS"|"FQDN"|"VM_MANAGER_ID"|"VM_MANAGED_OBJECT_REFERENCE"|"VM_NAME"|"VM_PATH"|"BIOS_ID"|"MOTHERBOARD_SERIAL_NUMBER",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Optional  boolean  flag  to  indicate whether any effect should take
          place. Used to test if the caller has permission to make the call.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
