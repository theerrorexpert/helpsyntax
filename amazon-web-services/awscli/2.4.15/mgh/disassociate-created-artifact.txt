DISASSOCIATE-CREATED-ARTIFACT()                DISASSOCIATE-CREATED-ARTIFACT()



NAME
       disassociate-created-artifact -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociates  a  created  artifact of an AWS resource with a migration
       task performed by a migration tool that was previously associated. This
       API has the following traits:

       o A  migration user can call the DisassociateCreatedArtifacts operation
         to disassociate a created AWS Artifact from a migration task.

       o The created artifact name must be provided in  ARN  (Amazon  Resource
         Name)  format  which  will contain information about type and region;
         for example: arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:488216288981:image/ami-6d0ba87b  .

       o Examples  of the AWS resource behind the created artifact are, AMI's,
         EC2 instance, or RDS instance, etc.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-created-artifact
          --progress-update-stream <value>
          --migration-task-name <value>
          --created-artifact-name <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --progress-update-stream (string)
          The name of the ProgressUpdateStream.

       --migration-task-name (string)
          Unique identifier that references the migration task to be  disasso-
          ciated  with the artifact. Do not store personal data in this field.

       --created-artifact-name (string)
          An ARN of the AWS resource related to the migration (e.g., AMI,  EC2
          instance, RDS instance, etc.)

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Optional  boolean  flag  to  indicate whether any effect should take
          place. Used to test if the caller has permission to make the call.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
