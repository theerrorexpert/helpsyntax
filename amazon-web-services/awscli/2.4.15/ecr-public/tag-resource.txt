TAG-RESOURCE()                                                  TAG-RESOURCE()



NAME
       tag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  the  specified  tags  to  a  resource  with  the  specified
       resourceArn . If existing tags on a resource are not specified  in  the
       request  parameters,  they are not changed. When a resource is deleted,
       the tags associated with that resource are deleted as well.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            tag-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          --tags <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource to which to add tags.
          Currently,  the  supported  resource is an Amazon ECR Public reposi-
          tory.

       --tags (list)
          The tags to add to the resource. A tag  is  an  array  of  key-value
          pairs.  Tag  keys can have a maximum character length of 128 charac-
          ters, and tag values can have a maximum length of 256 characters.

          (structure)
              The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you categorize
              and  organize  them.  Each tag consists of a key and an optional
              value, both of which you define. Tag keys  can  have  a  maximum
              character  length  of  128 characters, and tag values can have a
              maximum length of 256 characters.

              Key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key  is  a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a  tag.  A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
