OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The AWS account ID associated with the public registry  the  reposi-
          tory  is  in.  If  you do not specify a registry, the default public

          The name of the repository to create or update the catalog data for.

       --catalog-data (structure)

          publicly visible in the Amazon ECR Public Gallery.

          description -> (string)
              A short description of the contents of the repository. This text
              appears  in  both  the image details and also when searching for
              repositories on the Amazon ECR Public Gallery.

          architectures -> (list)
              The system architecture that the images in  the  repository  are
              compatible with. On the Amazon ECR Public Gallery, the following
              supported architectures will appear as badges on the  repository
              and are used as search filters.

              o Linux

              o Windows

              NOTE:
                 If  an  unsupported  tag  is added to your repository catalog
                 data, it will be associated with the repository  and  can  be
                 retrieved  using  the API but will not be discoverable in the
                 Amazon ECR Public Gallery.

              (string)

          operatingSystems -> (list)
              The operating systems that the images in the repository are com-
              patible  with.  On  the Amazon ECR Public Gallery, the following
              supported operating systems will appear as badges on the reposi-
              tory and are used as search filters.

              NOTE:
                 If  an  unsupported  tag  is added to your repository catalog
                 data, it will be associated with the repository  and  can  be
                 retrieved  using  the API but will not be discoverable in the
                 Amazon ECR Public Gallery.

              (string)

          logoImageBlob -> (blob)
              The base64-encoded repository logo payload.

              NOTE:
                 The repository logo is only publicly visible  in  the  Amazon
                 ECR Public Gallery for verified accounts.

          aboutText -> (string)
              A  detailed description of the contents of the repository. It is
              publicly visible in the Amazon ECR Public Gallery. The text must
              be in markdown format.

          usageText -> (string)
              Detailed  information  on how to use the contents of the reposi-
              tory. It is publicly visible in the Amazon ECR  Public  Gallery.
              The  usage text provides context, support information, and addi-
              tional usage details for users of the repository. The text  must
              be in markdown format.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          description=string,architectures=string,string,operatingSystems=string,string,logoImageBlob=blob,aboutText=string,usageText=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "description": "string",
            "architectures": ["string", ...],
            "operatingSystems": ["string", ...],
            "logoImageBlob": blob,
            "aboutText": "string",
            "usageText": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
