DESCRIBE-IMAGE-TAGS()                                    DESCRIBE-IMAGE-TAGS()



NAME
       describe-image-tags -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the image tag details for a repository in a public registry.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-image-tags is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: imageTagDetails

SYNOPSIS
            describe-image-tags
          [--registry-id <value>]
          --repository-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The AWS account ID associated with the public registry that contains
          the  repository in which to describe images. If you do not specify a
          registry, the default public registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository that contains the image  tag  details  to
          describe.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       imageTagDetails -> (list)
          The image tag details for the images in the requested repository.

          (structure)
              An object representing the image tag details for an image.

              imageTag -> (string)
                 The tag associated with the image.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time stamp indicating when the image tag was created.

              imageDetail -> (structure)
                 An object that describes the details of an image.

                 imageDigest -> (string)
                     The sha256 digest of the image manifest.

                 imageSizeInBytes -> (long)
                     The size, in bytes, of the image in the repository.

                     If the image is a manifest list, this  will  be  the  max
                     size of all manifests in the list.

                     NOTE:
                        Beginning  with  Docker version 1.9, the Docker client
                        compresses image layers before pushing them  to  a  V2
                        Docker  registry. The output of the docker images com-
                        mand shows the uncompressed  image  size,  so  it  may
                        return  a  larger  image  size  than  the  image sizes
                        returned by  DescribeImages .

                 imagePushedAt -> (timestamp)
                     The date and time, expressed in standard JavaScript  date
                     format,  at which the current image tag was pushed to the
                     repository.

                 imageManifestMediaType -> (string)
                     The media type of the image manifest.

                 artifactMediaType -> (string)
                     The artifact media type of the image.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value  to  include  in  a  future  DescribeImageTags
          request.  When  the  results  of  a DescribeImageTags request exceed
          maxResults , this value can be used to retrieve  the  next  page  of
          results.  This  value  is  null  when  there  are no more results to
          return.
