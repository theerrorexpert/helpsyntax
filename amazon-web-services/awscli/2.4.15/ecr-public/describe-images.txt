DESCRIBE-IMAGES()                                            DESCRIBE-IMAGES()



NAME
       describe-images -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns metadata about the images in a repository in a public registry.

       NOTE:
          Beginning with Docker version  1.9,  the  Docker  client  compresses
          image layers before pushing them to a V2 Docker registry. The output
          of the docker images command shows the uncompressed image  size,  so
          it  may  return a larger image size than the image sizes returned by
          DescribeImages .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-images is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: imageDetails

SYNOPSIS
            describe-images
          [--registry-id <value>]
          --repository-name <value>
          [--image-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registry-id (string)
          The AWS account ID associated with the public registry that contains
          the repository in which to describe images. If you do not specify  a
          registry, the default public registry is assumed.

       --repository-name (string)
          The repository that contains the images to describe.

       --image-ids (list)
          The list of image IDs for the requested repository.

          (structure)
              An  object with identifying information for an Amazon ECR image.

              imageDigest -> (string)
                 The sha256 digest of the image manifest.

              imageTag -> (string)
                 The tag used for the image.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          imageDigest=string,imageTag=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "imageDigest": "string",
              "imageTag": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       imageDetails -> (list)
          A list of  ImageDetail objects that contain data about the image.

          (structure)
              An  object that describes an image returned by a  DescribeImages
              operation.

              registryId -> (string)
                 The AWS account ID associated with  the  public  registry  to
                 which this image belongs.

              repositoryName -> (string)
                 The name of the repository to which this image belongs.

              imageDigest -> (string)
                 The sha256 digest of the image manifest.

              imageTags -> (list)
                 The list of tags associated with this image.

                 (string)

              imageSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of the image in the repository.

                 If the image is a manifest list, this will be the max size of
                 all manifests in the list.

                 NOTE:
                     Beginning with Docker version 1.9, the Docker client com-
                     presses  image  layers before pushing them to a V2 Docker
                     registry. The output of the docker images  command  shows
                     the  uncompressed  image  size, so it may return a larger
                     image size than the image sizes returned by   DescribeIm-
                     ages .

              imagePushedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, expressed in standard JavaScript date for-
                 mat, at which the current image was pushed to the repository.

              imageManifestMediaType -> (string)
                 The media type of the image manifest.

              artifactMediaType -> (string)
                 The artifact media type of the image.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value to include in a future DescribeImages request.
          When the results of a DescribeImages  request  exceed  maxResults  ,
          this  value  can  be used to retrieve the next page of results. This
          value is null when there are no more results to return.
