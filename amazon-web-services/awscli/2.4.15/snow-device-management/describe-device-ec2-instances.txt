NAME
       describe-device-ec2-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Checks  the  current  state  of the Amazon EC2 instances. The output is
       similar to describeDevice , but the results are sourced from the device
       cache  in  the  Amazon  Web  Services Cloud and include a subset of the
       available fields.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-device-ec2-instances
          --instance-ids <value>
          --managed-device-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-ids (list)
          A list of instance IDs associated with the managed device.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --managed-device-id (string)
          The ID of the managed device.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 state -> (structure)
                     The description of the current state of an instance.

                     code -> (integer)
                        The  state  of the instance as a 16-bit unsigned inte-
                        ger.

                        The high byte is all  of  the  bits  between  2^8  and
                        (2^16)-1,  which equals decimal values between 256 and
                        65,535. These numerical values are used  for  internal
                        purposes and should be ignored.

                        The  low  byte  is  all  of  the  bits between 2^0 and
                        (2^8)-1, which equals decimal  values  between  0  and
                        255.

                        The  valid  values for the instance state code are all
                        in the range of the low byte. These values are:

                        o 0 : pending

                        o 16 : running

                        o 32 : shutting-down

                        o 48 : terminated

                        o 64 : stopping

                        o 80 : stopped

                        You can ignore the high byte value by zeroing out  all
                        of the bits above 2^8 or 256 in decimal.

                     name -> (string)
                        The current state of the instance.

                 updatedAt -> (timestamp)
                     When the instance was last updated.

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 When the instance summary was last updated.
