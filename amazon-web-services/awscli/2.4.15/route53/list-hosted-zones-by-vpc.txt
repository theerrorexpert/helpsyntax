LIST-HOSTED-ZONES-BY-VPC()                          LIST-HOSTED-ZONES-BY-VPC()



NAME
       list-hosted-zones-by-vpc -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  the private hosted zones that a specified VPC is associated
       with, regardless of which Amazon Web Services  account  or  Amazon  Web
       Services  service  owns the hosted zones. The HostedZoneOwner structure
       in the response contains one of the following values:

       o An OwningAccount element, which contains the account number of either
         the  current  Amazon  Web Services account or another Amazon Web Ser-
         vices account. Some services, such as Cloud Map, create hosted  zones
         using the current account.

       o An  OwningService  element,  which identifies the Amazon Web Services
         service that created and owns the hosted  zone.  For  example,  if  a
         hosted  zone  was created by Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS),
         the value of Owner is efs.amazonaws.com .

SYNOPSIS
            list-hosted-zones-by-vpc
          --vpc-id <value>
          --vpc-region <value>
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --vpc-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon VPC that you want to list hosted zones for.

       --vpc-region (string)
          For the Amazon VPC that you specified for VPCId  ,  the  Amazon  Web
          Services Region that you created the VPC in.

          Possible values:

          o us-east-1

          o us-east-2

          o us-west-1

          o us-west-2

          o eu-west-1

          o eu-west-2

          o eu-west-3

          o eu-central-1

          o ap-east-1

          o me-south-1

          o us-gov-west-1

          o us-gov-east-1

          o us-iso-east-1

          o us-iso-west-1

          o us-isob-east-1

          o ap-southeast-1

          o ap-southeast-2

          o ap-southeast-3

          o ap-south-1

          o ap-northeast-1

          o ap-northeast-2

          o ap-northeast-3

          o eu-north-1

          o sa-east-1

          o ca-central-1

          o cn-north-1

          o af-south-1

          o eu-south-1

       --max-items (string)
          (Optional)  The  maximum number of hosted zones that you want Amazon
          Route 53 to return. If the specified VPC  is  associated  with  more
          than  MaxItems  hosted zones, the response includes a NextToken ele-
          ment. NextToken contains an  encrypted  token  that  identifies  the
          first  hosted  zone  that Route 53 will return if you submit another
          request.

       --next-token (string)
          If the previous response included a NextToken element, the specified
          VPC  is associated with more hosted zones. To get more hosted zones,
          submit another ListHostedZonesByVPC request.

          For the value of NextToken , specify the value of NextToken from the
          previous response.

          If  the  previous response didn't include a NextToken element, there
          are no more hosted zones to get.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       HostedZoneSummaries -> (list)
          A list that contains one HostedZoneSummary element for  each  hosted
          zone  that the specified Amazon VPC is associated with. Each Hosted-
          ZoneSummary element contains the hosted zone name and ID, and infor-
          mation about who owns the hosted zone.

          (structure)
              In  the  response to a ListHostedZonesByVPC request, the Hosted-
              ZoneSummaries element contains one HostedZoneSummary element for
              each  hosted  zone  that  the specified Amazon VPC is associated
              with. Each HostedZoneSummary element contains  the  hosted  zone
              name and ID, and information about who owns the hosted zone.

              HostedZoneId -> (string)
                 The Route 53 hosted zone ID of a private hosted zone that the
                 specified VPC is associated with.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the private hosted zone, such as example.com .

              Owner -> (structure)
                 The owner of a private hosted zone that the specified VPC  is
                 associated  with.  The owner can be either an Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices account or an Amazon Web Services service.

                 OwningAccount -> (string)
                     If the hosted zone was created by an Amazon Web  Services
                     account, or was created by an Amazon Web Services service
                     that creates hosted zones using the current account, Own-
                     ingAccount  contains  the account ID of that account. For
                     example, when you use Cloud Map to create a hosted  zone,
                     Cloud  Map creates the hosted zone using the current Ama-
                     zon Web Services account.

                 OwningService -> (string)
                     If an Amazon Web Services service uses its own account to
                     create a hosted zone and associate the specified VPC with
                     that hosted zone, OwningService contains an  abbreviation
                     that identifies the service. For example, if Amazon Elas-
                     tic File System (Amazon EFS) created a  hosted  zone  and
                     associated  a VPC with the hosted zone, the value of Own-
                     ingService is efs.amazonaws.com .

       MaxItems -> (string)
          The value that  you  specified  for  MaxItems  in  the  most  recent
          ListHostedZonesByVPC request.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  value  that  you will use for NextToken in the next ListHosted-
          ZonesByVPC request.
