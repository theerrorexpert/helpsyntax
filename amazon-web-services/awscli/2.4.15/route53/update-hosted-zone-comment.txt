NAME
       update-hosted-zone-comment -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the comment for a specified hosted zone.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-hosted-zone-comment
          --id <value>
          [--comment <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The  ID for the hosted zone that you want to update the comment for.

       --comment (string)
          The new comment for the hosted zone. If you don't  specify  a  value
          for Comment , Amazon Route 53 deletes the existing value of the Com-
          ment element, if any.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       HostedZone -> (structure)
          A complex type that  contains  the  response  to  the  UpdateHosted-
          ZoneComment request.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the hosted zone when you
              created it.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the domain. For public hosted  zones,  this  is  the
              name that you have registered with your DNS registrar.

              For information about how to specify characters other than a-z ,
              0-9 , and - (hyphen) and how to specify internationalized domain
              names, see CreateHostedZone .

          CallerReference -> (string)
              The  value  that you specified for CallerReference when you cre-
              ated the hosted zone.

          Config -> (structure)
              A complex type that includes the Comment  and  PrivateZone  ele-
              ments.  If you omitted the HostedZoneConfig and Comment elements
              from the request, the Config and Comment elements  don't  appear
              in the response.

              Comment -> (string)
                 Any  comments that you want to include about the hosted zone.

                 A value that indicates whether this is a private hosted zone.

          ResourceRecordSetCount -> (long)
              The number of resource record sets in the hosted zone.

          LinkedService -> (structure)
              If  the  hosted zone was created by another service, the service
              that created the hosted zone. When a hosted zone is  created  by
              another service, you can't edit or delete it using Route 53.

              ServicePrincipal -> (string)
                 If  the  health  check  or hosted zone was created by another
                 service, the  service  that  created  the  resource.  When  a
                 resource  is  created  by  another service, you can't edit or
                 delete it using Amazon Route 53.

                 service,  an optional description that can be provided by the
                 other service. When a resource is created by another service,
