       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-reusable-delegation-set-limit
          --type <value>
          --delegation-set-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --type (string)
          Specify MAX_ZONES_BY_REUSABLE_DELEGATION_SET to get the maximum num-
          ber of hosted zones that you can associate with the specified  reus-
          able delegation set.

          Possible values:

          o MAX_ZONES_BY_REUSABLE_DELEGATION_SET

       --delegation-set-id (string)
          The ID of the delegation set that you want to get the limit for.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              TION_SET , the maximum number of hosted zones that you can asso-
              ciate with the specified reusable delegation set.

          Value -> (long)
