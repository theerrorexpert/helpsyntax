SYNOPSIS
            list-tags-for-resources
          --resource-type <value>
          --resource-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-type (string)
          The type of the resources.

          o The resource type for health checks is healthcheck .

          o The resource type for hosted zones is hostedzone .

          Possible values:

          o healthcheck

          o hostedzone

       --resource-ids (list)
          A complex  type  that  contains  the  ResourceId  element  for  each
          resource for which you want to get a list of tags.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ResourceTagSets -> (list)
          A list of ResourceTagSet s containing tags associated with the spec-
          ified resources.

          (structure)
              A complex type containing a resource and its associated tags.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of the resource.

                 o The resource type for health checks is healthcheck .

                 o The resource type for hosted zones is hostedzone .

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The ID for the specified resource.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags associated with the specified resource.

                 (structure)
                     A complex type that contains information about a tag that
                     you want to add or edit for the specified health check or
                     hosted zone.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The value of Key depends on  the  operation  that  you
                        want to perform:

                        o Add  a tag to a health check or hosted zone : Key is
                          the name that you want to give the new tag.

                        o Edit a tag : Key is the name of  the  tag  that  you
                          want to change the Value for.

                        o Delete  a  key : Key is the name of the tag you want
                          to remove.

                        o Give a name to a health check  :  Edit  the  default
                          Name  tag.  In the Amazon Route 53 console, the list
                          of your health checks includes a  Name  column  that
                          lets  you  see  the  name  that you've given to each
                          health check.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of Value depends on the operation  that  you
                        want to perform:

                        o Add  a  tag to a health check or hosted zone : Value
                          is the value that you want to give the new tag.

                        o Edit a tag : Value is the new value that you want to
                          assign the tag.
