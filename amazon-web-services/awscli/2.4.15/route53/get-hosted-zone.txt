GET-HOSTED-ZONE()                                            GET-HOSTED-ZONE()



NAME
       get-hosted-zone -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information about a specified hosted zone including the four name
       servers assigned to the hosted zone.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-hosted-zone
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the hosted zone that you want to get information about.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The following get-hosted-zone command gets information about the hosted
       zone with an id of Z1R8UBAEXAMPLE:

          aws route53 get-hosted-zone --id Z1R8UBAEXAMPLE

OUTPUT
       HostedZone -> (structure)
          A complex type that contains general information about the specified
          hosted zone.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the hosted zone when you
              created it.

          Name -> (string)
              The  name  of  the  domain. For public hosted zones, this is the
              name that you have registered with your DNS registrar.

              For information about how to specify characters other than a-z ,
              0-9 , and - (hyphen) and how to specify internationalized domain
              names, see CreateHostedZone .

          CallerReference -> (string)
              The value that you specified for CallerReference when  you  cre-
              ated the hosted zone.

          Config -> (structure)
              A  complex  type  that includes the Comment and PrivateZone ele-
              ments. If you omitted the HostedZoneConfig and Comment  elements
              from  the  request, the Config and Comment elements don't appear
              in the response.

              Comment -> (string)
                 Any comments that you want to include about the hosted  zone.

              PrivateZone -> (boolean)
                 A value that indicates whether this is a private hosted zone.

          ResourceRecordSetCount -> (long)
              The number of resource record sets in the hosted zone.

          LinkedService -> (structure)
              If the hosted zone was created by another service,  the  service

              ServicePrincipal -> (string)
                 If the health check or hosted zone  was  created  by  another
                 service,  the  service  that  created  the  resource.  When a
                 resource is created by another service,  you  can't  edit  or
                 delete it using Amazon Route 53.

                 If  the  health  check  or hosted zone was created by another
                 service, an optional description that can be provided by  the
                 other service. When a resource is created by another service,
                 you can't edit or delete it using Amazon Route 53.

       DelegationSet -> (structure)
          A complex type that lists the Amazon Route 53 name servers  for  the
          specified hosted zone.

          Id -> (string)
              The  ID  that  Amazon  Route 53 assigns to a reusable delegation
              set.

          CallerReference -> (string)
              The value that you specified for CallerReference when  you  cre-
              ated the reusable delegation set.

          NameServers -> (list)
              A  complex  type  that contains a list of the authoritative name
              servers for a hosted zone or for a reusable delegation set.

              (string)

       VPCs -> (list)
          A complex type that contains information about  the  VPCs  that  are
          associated with the specified hosted zone.

          (structure)
              (Private  hosted zones only) A complex type that contains infor-
              mation about an Amazon VPC.

              If you associate a private hosted zone with an Amazon  VPC  when
              you  make  a  CreateHostedZone request, the following parameters
              are also required.

              VPCRegion -> (string)
                 (Private hosted zones only) The region that an Amazon VPC was
                 created in.
