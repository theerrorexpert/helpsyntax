DELETE-HEALTH-CHECK()                                    DELETE-HEALTH-CHECK()



NAME
       delete-health-check -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a health check.

       WARNING:
          Amazon  Route  53  does not prevent you from deleting a health check
          even if the health check is associated with  one  or  more  resource
          record  sets.  If you delete a health check and you don't update the
          associated resource record sets, the future  status  of  the  health
          check  can't be predicted and may change. This will affect the rout-
          ing of DNS queries for your DNS  failover  configuration.  For  more
          information,  see Replacing and Deleting Health Checks in the Amazon
          Route 53 Developer Guide .

       If you're using Cloud Map and you configured  Cloud  Map  to  create  a
       Route  53 health check when you register an instance, you can't use the
       Route 53 DeleteHealthCheck command to  delete  the  health  check.  The
       health check is deleted automatically when you deregister the instance;
       there can be a delay of  several  hours  before  the  health  check  is
       deleted from Route 53.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-health-check
          --health-check-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --health-check-id (string)
          The ID of the health check that you want to delete.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
