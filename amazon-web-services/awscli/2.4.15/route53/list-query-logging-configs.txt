LIST-QUERY-LOGGING-CONFIGS()                      LIST-QUERY-LOGGING-CONFIGS()



NAME
       list-query-logging-configs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the configurations for DNS query logging that are associated with
       the current Amazon Web Services account or the  configuration  that  is
       associated with a specified hosted zone.

       For more information about DNS query logs, see CreateQueryLoggingConfig
       . Additional information, including  the  format  of  DNS  query  logs,
       appears in Logging DNS Queries in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-query-logging-configs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: QueryLoggingConfigs

SYNOPSIS
            list-query-logging-configs
          [--hosted-zone-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          (Optional)  If you want to list the query logging configuration that
          is associated with a hosted zone, specify the ID in HostedZoneId .

          If you don't  specify  a  hosted  zone  ID,  ListQueryLoggingConfigs
          returns  all of the configurations that are associated with the cur-
          rent Amazon Web Services account.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (string)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list query logging configurations

       The  following  list-query-logging-configs  example  lists  information
       about the first 100 query logging configurations in your  AWS  account,
       for the hosted zone Z1OX3WQEXAMPLE.

          aws route53 list-query-logging-configs \
              --hosted-zone-id Z1OX3WQEXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "QueryLoggingConfigs": [
                  {
                      "Id": "964ff34e-ae03-4f06-80a2-9683cexample",
                      "HostedZoneId": "Z1OX3WQEXAMPLE",
                      "CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn": "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111122223333:log-group:/aws/route53/example.com:*"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       QueryLoggingConfigs -> (list)
          An array that contains one QueryLoggingConfig element for each  con-
          figuration for DNS query logging that is associated with the current
          Amazon Web Services account.

          (structure)
              A complex type that contains information about  a  configuration
              for DNS query logging.

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID for a configuration for DNS query logging.

              HostedZoneId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  the  hosted zone that CloudWatch Logs is logging
                 queries for.

              CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  CloudWatch  Logs  log
                 group that Amazon Route 53 is publishing logs to.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  a response includes the last of the query logging configurations
          that are associated with the current Amazon  Web  Services  account,
          NextToken doesn't appear in the response.

          If  a  response  doesn't include the last of the configurations, you
          can    get    more    configurations    by    submitting     another
          ListQueryLoggingConfigs  request.  Get  the  value of NextToken that
          Amazon Route 53 returned in the previous response and include it  in
          NextToken in the next request.
