NAME
       test-dns-answer -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  value  that  Amazon  Route  53  returns in response to a DNS
       request for a specified record name and type. You can optionally  spec-
       ify  the  IP  address  of  a  DNS  resolver,  an EDNS0 client subnet IP
       address, and a subnet mask.

       This call only supports querying public hosted zones.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            test-dns-answer
          --hosted-zone-id <value>
          --record-name <value>
          --record-type <value>
          [--resolver-ip <value>]
          [--edns0-client-subnet-ip <value>]
          [--edns0-client-subnet-mask <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          The ID of the hosted zone that you want Amazon Route 53 to  simulate
          a query for.

       --record-name (string)
          The name of the resource record set that you want Amazon Route 53 to
          simulate a query for.

       --record-type (string)
          The type of the resource record set.

          Possible values:

          o SOA

          o A

          o TXT

          o NS

          o CNAME

          o MX

          o NAPTR

          o PTR

          o SRV

          o SPF

          o AAAA

          o CAA

          o DS

       --resolver-ip (string)
          If you want to simulate a request  from  a  specific  DNS  resolver,
          specify  the  IP  address for that resolver. If you omit this value,
          TestDnsAnswer uses the IP address of a DNS resolver  in  the  Amazon
          Web Services US East (N. Virginia) Region (us-east-1 ).

       --edns0-client-subnet-ip (string)
          If  the  resolver  that you specified for resolverip supports EDNS0,
          specify the IPv4 or IPv6 address of a client in the applicable loca-
          tion, for example, 192.0.2.44 or 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334 .

       --edns0-client-subnet-mask (string)
          If  you  specify  an  IP  address  for edns0clientsubnetip , you can
          optionally specify the number of bits of the  IP  address  that  you
          want  the checking tool to include in the DNS query. For example, if
          you  specify  192.0.2.44  for   edns0clientsubnetip   and   24   for
          edns0clientsubnetmask  ,  the  checking tool will simulate a request
          from 192.0.2.0/24. The default value is 24 bits for  IPv4  addresses
          and 64 bits for IPv6 addresses.

          The  range of valid values depends on whether edns0clientsubnetip is
          an IPv4 or an IPv6 address:

          o IPv4 : Specify a value between 0 and 32

          o IPv6 : Specify a value between 0 and 128

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Nameserver -> (string)
          The Amazon Route 53 name server used to respond to the request.

       RecordName -> (string)
          The name of the resource record set that  you  submitted  a  request
          for.

       RecordType -> (string)
          The  type  of  the  resource record set that you submitted a request
          for.

       RecordData -> (list)
          A list that contains values that Amazon Route 53 returned  for  this
          resource record set.

          (string)
              A  value  that Amazon Route 53 returned for this resource record
              set. A RecordDataEntry element is one of the following:

              o For non-alias resource record sets, a RecordDataEntry  element
                contains one value in the resource record set. If the resource
                record set contains multiple values, the response includes one
                RecordDataEntry element for each value.

              o For  multiple resource record sets that have the same name and
                type,  which  includes  weighted,  latency,  geolocation,  and
                failover,  a  RecordDataEntry  element contains the value from
                the appropriate resource record set based on the request.

              o For alias resource record sets that refer to Amazon  Web  Ser-
                vices  resources  other  than another resource record set, the
                RecordDataEntry element contains an IP  address  or  a  domain
                name  for  the  Amazon Web Services resource, depending on the
                type of resource.

              o For alias resource record sets that refer  to  other  resource
                record sets, a RecordDataEntry element contains one value from
                the referenced resource record set. If the referenced resource
                record set contains multiple values, the response includes one
                RecordDataEntry element for each value.

       ResponseCode -> (string)
          A code that indicates whether the request is valid or not. The  most
          common response code is NOERROR , meaning that the request is valid.
          If the response is not valid, Amazon Route  53  returns  a  response
          code  that  describes  the  error.  For  a list of possible response
          codes, see DNS RCODES on the IANA website.

       Protocol -> (string)
          The protocol that Amazon Route 53 used to respond  to  the  request,
          either UDP or TCP .
