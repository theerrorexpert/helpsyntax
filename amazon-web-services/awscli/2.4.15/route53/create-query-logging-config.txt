CREATE-QUERY-LOGGING-CONFIG()                    CREATE-QUERY-LOGGING-CONFIG()



NAME
       create-query-logging-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a configuration for DNS query logging. After you create a query
       logging configuration, Amazon Route 53 begins to publish log data to an
       Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group.

       DNS  query  logs  contain  information  about the queries that Route 53
       receives for a specified public hosted zone, such as the following:

       o Route 53 edge location that responded to the DNS query

       o Domain or subdomain that was requested

       o DNS record type, such as A or AAAA

       o DNS response code, such as NoError or ServFail

         Log Group and Resource Policy

       Before you create a query logging configuration, perform the  following
       operations.

       NOTE:
          If  you create a query logging configuration using the Route 53 con-
          sole, Route 53 performs these operations automatically.

       o Create a CloudWatch Logs log group, and make note of the  ARN,  which
         you  specify  when you create a query logging configuration. Note the
         following:

         o You must create the log group in the us-east-1 region.

         o You must use the same Amazon Web Services account to create the log
           group  and the hosted zone that you want to configure query logging
           for.

         o When you create log groups for query logging, we recommend that you
           use a consistent prefix, for example:
           ``
           /aws/route53/hosted  zone name ``   In the next step, you'll create
           a resource policy, which controls access to one or more log  groups
           and  the associated Amazon Web Services resources, such as Route 53
           hosted zones. There's a limit on the number  of  resource  policies
           that you can create, so we recommend that you use a consistent pre-
           fix so you can use the same resource policy for all the log  groups
           that you create for query logging.

       o Create a CloudWatch Logs resource policy, and give it the permissions
         that Route 53 needs to create log streams and to send query  logs  to
         log  streams. For the value of Resource , specify the ARN for the log
         group that you created in the previous step. To use the same resource
         policy  for  all  the CloudWatch Logs log groups that you created for
         query logging configurations, replace the hosted zone name with  *  ,
         for                                                          example:
         arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123412341234:log-group:/aws/route53/*

       NOTE:
              You can't use  the  CloudWatch  console  to  create  or  edit  a
              resource  policy.  You  must  use the CloudWatch API, one of the
              Amazon Web Services SDKs, or the CLI.

          Log Streams and Edge Locations

       When Route 53 finishes creating the configuration for  DNS  query  log-
       ging, it does the following:

       o Creates  a  log  stream  for an edge location the first time that the
         edge location responds to DNS queries for the specified hosted  zone.
         That  log stream is used to log all queries that Route 53 responds to
         for that edge location.

       o Begins to send query logs to the applicable log stream.

       The name of each log stream is in the following format:
          `` hosted zone ID /edge location code ``

       The edge location code  is  a  three-letter  code  and  an  arbitrarily
       assigned  number,  for  example,  DFW3. The three-letter code typically
       corresponds with the International Air  Transport  Association  airport
       code  for an airport near the edge location. (These abbreviations might
       change in the future.) For a list of edge locations, see "The Route  53
       Global Network" on the Route 53 Product Details page.
          Queries That Are Logged

       Query logs contain only the queries that DNS resolvers forward to Route
       53. If a DNS resolver has already cached the response to a query  (such
       as  the  IP  address for a load balancer for example.com), the resolver
       will continue to return the cached response. It doesn't forward another
       query  to  Route 53 until the TTL for the corresponding resource record
       set expires. Depending on how many DNS  queries  are  submitted  for  a
       resource  record set, and depending on the TTL for that resource record
       set, query logs might contain information about only one query  out  of
       every  several  thousand  queries  that  are submitted to DNS. For more
       information about how DNS works, see Routing Internet Traffic  to  Your
       Website or Web Application in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .
          Log File Format

       For  a  list  of  the  values  in each query log and the format of each
       value, see Logging DNS Queries in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .
          Pricing

       For  information  about  charges  for query logs, see Amazon CloudWatch
       Pricing .
          How to Stop Logging

       If you want Route 53 to stop sending query  logs  to  CloudWatch  Logs,
       delete  the  query  logging  configuration.  For  more information, see
       DeleteQueryLoggingConfig .

SYNOPSIS
            create-query-logging-config
          --hosted-zone-id <value>
          --cloud-watch-logs-log-group-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          The ID of the hosted zone that you want to log queries for. You  can
          log queries only for public hosted zones.

       --cloud-watch-logs-log-group-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) for the log group that you want to
          Amazon Route 53 to send query logs to. This is  the  format  of  the
          ARN:

          arn:aws:logs:region :account-id :log-group:log_group_name

          To  get the ARN for a log group, you can use the CloudWatch console,
          the DescribeLogGroups API action, the  describe-log-groups  command,
          or the applicable command in one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT

          tion, the ID of the hosted zone that you want to  log  queries  for,
          and  the ARN for the log group that you want Amazon Route 53 to send
          query logs to.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID for a configuration for DNS query logging.

          HostedZoneId -> (string)
              The ID of the  hosted  zone  that  CloudWatch  Logs  is  logging
              queries for.

          CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CloudWatch Logs log group

          The unique URL representing the new query logging configuration.
