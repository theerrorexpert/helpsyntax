LIST-HOSTED-ZONES-BY-NAME()                        LIST-HOSTED-ZONES-BY-NAME()



NAME
       list-hosted-zones-by-name -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list  of  your  hosted  zones in lexicographic order. The
       response includes a HostedZones child element for each hosted zone cre-
       ated by the current Amazon Web Services account.
          ListHostedZonesByName  sorts  hosted  zones  by name with the labels
          reversed. For example:

          com.example.www.

       Note the trailing dot, which can change the sort order in some  circum-
       stances.

       If  the domain name includes escape characters or Punycode, ListHosted-
       ZonesByName alphabetizes the domain name using the escaped or Punycoded
       value,  which is the format that Amazon Route 53 saves in its database.
       For example, to create  a  hosted  zone  for  exmple.com,  you  specify
       ex344mple.com  for  the domain name. ListHostedZonesByName alphabetizes
       it as:
          com.ex\344mple.

       The labels are reversed and alphabetized using the escaped  value.  For
       more  information  about  valid domain name formats, including interna-
       tionalized domain names, see DNS Domain Name Format in the Amazon Route
       53 Developer Guide .

       Route 53 returns up to 100 items in each response. If you have a lot of
       hosted zones, use the MaxItems parameter to list them in groups  of  up
       to  100. The response includes values that help navigate from one group
       of MaxItems hosted zones to the next:

       o The DNSName and HostedZoneId elements in  the  response  contain  the
         values, if any, specified for the dnsname and hostedzoneid parameters
         in the request that produced the current response.

       o The MaxItems element in the response contains the value, if any, that
         you specified for the maxitems parameter in the request that produced
         the current response.

       o If the value of IsTruncated in the response is true, there  are  more
         hosted zones associated with the current Amazon Web Services account.
         If IsTruncated is false, this response includes the last hosted  zone
         that  is associated with the current account. The NextDNSName element
         and NextHostedZoneId elements are omitted from the response.

       o The NextDNSName and NextHostedZoneId elements in the response contain
         the  domain  name and the hosted zone ID of the next hosted zone that
         is associated with the current Amazon Web Services  account.  If  you
         want to list more hosted zones, make another call to ListHostedZones-
         ByName , and specify the value of NextDNSName and NextHostedZoneId in
         the dnsname and hostedzoneid parameters, respectively.

SYNOPSIS
            list-hosted-zones-by-name
          [--dns-name <value>]
          [--hosted-zone-id <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dns-name (string)
          (Optional) For your first request to ListHostedZonesByName , include
          the dnsname parameter only if you want to specify the  name  of  the
          first  hosted zone in the response. If you don't include the dnsname
          parameter, Amazon Route 53 returns all of the hosted zones that were
          created  by the current Amazon Web Services account, in ASCII order.
          For subsequent  requests,  include  both  dnsname  and  hostedzoneid
          parameters.  For dnsname , specify the value of NextDNSName from the
          previous response.

       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          (Optional) For your first request to ListHostedZonesByName , do  not
          include the hostedzoneid parameter.

          If you have more hosted zones than the value of maxitems , ListHost-
          edZonesByName returns only the first maxitems hosted zones.  To  get
          the  next  group of maxitems hosted zones, submit another request to
          ListHostedZonesByName and  include  both  dnsname  and  hostedzoneid
          parameters. For the value of hostedzoneid , specify the value of the
          NextHostedZoneId element from the previous response.

       --max-items (string)
          The maximum number of hosted zones to be included  in  the  response
          body  for this request. If you have more than maxitems hosted zones,
          then the value of the IsTruncated element in the response  is  true,
          and the values of NextDNSName and NextHostedZoneId specify the first
          hosted zone in the next group of maxitems hosted zones.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       The following command lists up to 100 hosted zones  ordered  by  domain
       name:

          aws route53 list-hosted-zones-by-name

       Output:

          {
            "HostedZones": [
                {

OUTPUT
       HostedZones -> (list)
          A complex type that contains general information  about  the  hosted
          zone.

          (structure)
              A  complex  type  that  contains  general  information about the
              hosted zone.

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the hosted zone  when
                 you created it.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the domain. For public hosted zones, this is the
                 name that you have registered with your DNS registrar.

                 For information about how to specify  characters  other  than
                 a-z  , 0-9 , and - (hyphen) and how to specify international-
                 ized domain names, see CreateHostedZone .

              CallerReference -> (string)
                 The value that you specified  for  CallerReference  when  you
                 created the hosted zone.

              Config -> (structure)
                 A complex type that includes the Comment and PrivateZone ele-
                 ments. If you omitted the HostedZoneConfig and  Comment  ele-
                 ments from the request, the Config and Comment elements don't
                 appear in the response.

                 Comment -> (string)
                     Any comments that you want to include  about  the  hosted
                     zone.

                 PrivateZone -> (boolean)
                     A  value  that indicates whether this is a private hosted
                     zone.

              ResourceRecordSetCount -> (long)
                 The number of resource record sets in the hosted zone.

              LinkedService -> (structure)
                 If the hosted zone was created by another service,  the  ser-
                 vice that created the hosted zone. When a hosted zone is cre-
                 ated by another service, you can't edit or  delete  it  using
                 Route 53.

                 ServicePrincipal -> (string)
                     If the health check or hosted zone was created by another
                     service, the service that created the  resource.  When  a
                     resource is created by another service, you can't edit or
                     delete it using Amazon Route 53.

                 Description -> (string)
                     If the health check or hosted zone was created by another
                     service,  an optional description that can be provided by
                     the other service. When a resource is created by  another
                     service,  you  can't edit or delete it using Amazon Route
                     53.

       DNSName -> (string)
          For the second  and  subsequent  calls  to  ListHostedZonesByName  ,
          DNSName is the value that you specified for the dnsname parameter in
          the request that produced the current response.

       HostedZoneId -> (string)
          The ID that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the  hosted  zone  when  you
          created it.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A  flag  that  indicates  whether  there are more hosted zones to be
          listed. If the response was truncated, you can get the next group of
          maxitems  hosted  zones  by  calling ListHostedZonesByName again and
          specifying the values of NextDNSName and  NextHostedZoneId  elements
          in the dnsname and hostedzoneid parameters.

       NextDNSName -> (string)
          If  IsTruncated is true, the value of NextDNSName is the name of the
          first hosted zone in the next group of maxitems hosted  zones.  Call
          ListHostedZonesByName again and specify the value of NextDNSName and
          NextHostedZoneId in the dnsname and hostedzoneid parameters, respec-
          tively.

          This element is present only if IsTruncated is true .

       NextHostedZoneId -> (string)
          If  IsTruncated  is  true , the value of NextHostedZoneId identifies
          the first hosted zone in the next group of  maxitems  hosted  zones.
          Call   ListHostedZonesByName   again   and   specify  the  value  of
          NextDNSName and NextHostedZoneId in  the  dnsname  and  hostedzoneid
          parameters, respectively.

          This element is present only if IsTruncated is true .

       MaxItems -> (string)
          The  value that you specified for the maxitems parameter in the call
          to ListHostedZonesByName that produced the current response.
