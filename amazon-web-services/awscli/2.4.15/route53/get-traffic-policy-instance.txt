GET-TRAFFIC-POLICY-INSTANCE()                    GET-TRAFFIC-POLICY-INSTANCE()



NAME
       get-traffic-policy-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a specified traffic policy instance.

       NOTE:
          After  you  submit  a  CreateTrafficPolicyInstance or an UpdateTraf-
          ficPolicyInstance request, there's a brief delay while Amazon  Route
          53  creates the resource record sets that are specified in the traf-
          fic policy definition. For more information, see the State  response
          element.

       NOTE:
          In  the Route 53 console, traffic policy instances are known as pol-
          icy records.

SYNOPSIS
            get-traffic-policy-instance
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the traffic policy instance that you want to get  informa-
          tion about.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          TTL -> (long)

              Route 53 is creating the  resource  record  sets.  Use  GetTraf-
              ficPolicyInstance  to  confirm  that  the CreateTrafficPolicyIn-
              stance request completed successfully.
                 Failed

              Route 53 wasn't able to create or  update  the  resource  record
