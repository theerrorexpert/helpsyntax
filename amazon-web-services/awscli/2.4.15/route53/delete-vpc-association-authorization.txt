DELETE-VPC-ASSOCIATION-AUTHORIZATION()  DELETE-VPC-ASSOCIATION-AUTHORIZATION()



NAME
       delete-vpc-association-authorization -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  authorization  to submit an AssociateVPCWithHostedZone request
       to associate a specified VPC with a hosted zone that was created  by  a
       different  account.  You  must  use the account that created the hosted
       zone to submit a DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorization request.

       WARNING:
          Sending this request only prevents the Amazon Web  Services  account
          that  created the VPC from associating the VPC with the Amazon Route
          53 hosted zone in the future. If the VPC is already associated  with
          the  hosted zone, DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorization won't disassoci-
          ate the VPC from the hosted zone. If you want to delete an  existing
          association, use DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-vpc-association-authorization
          --hosted-zone-id <value>
          --vpc <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          When  removing  authorization to associate a VPC that was created by
          one Amazon Web Services account with a hosted zone that was  created
          with  a  different Amazon Web Services account, the ID of the hosted
          zone.

       --vpc (structure)
          When removing authorization to associate a VPC that was  created  by
          one  Amazon Web Services account with a hosted zone that was created
          with a different Amazon Web Services account, a  complex  type  that
          includes the ID and region of the VPC.

          VPCRegion -> (string)
              (Private  hosted  zones  only) The region that an Amazon VPC was
              created in.

          VPCId -> (string)
              (Private hosted zones only) The ID of an Amazon VPC.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          VPCRegion=string,VPCId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "VPCRegion": "us-east-1"|"us-east-2"|"us-west-1"|"us-west-2"|"eu-west-1"|"eu-west-2"|"eu-west-3"|"eu-central-1"|"ap-east-1"|"me-south-1"|"us-gov-west-1"|"us-gov-east-1"|"us-iso-east-1"|"us-iso-west-1"|"us-isob-east-1"|"ap-southeast-1"|"ap-southeast-2"|"ap-southeast-3"|"ap-south-1"|"ap-northeast-1"|"ap-northeast-2"|"ap-northeast-3"|"eu-north-1"|"sa-east-1"|"ca-central-1"|"cn-north-1"|"af-south-1"|"eu-south-1",
            "VPCId": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
