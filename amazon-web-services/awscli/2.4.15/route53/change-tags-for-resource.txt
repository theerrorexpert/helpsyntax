       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command adds a tag named owner to a healthcheck  resource
       specified by ID:

          aws route53 change-tags-for-resource --resource-type healthcheck --resource-id 6233434j-18c1-34433-ba8e-3443434 --add-tags Key=owner,Value=myboss

       The  following  command  removes  a  tag named owner from a hosted zone
       resource specified by ID:

          aws route53 change-tags-for-resource --resource-type hostedzone --resource-id Z1523434445 --remove-tag-keys owner

OUTPUT
       None
