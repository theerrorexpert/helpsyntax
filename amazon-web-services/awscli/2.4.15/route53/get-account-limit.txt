SYNOPSIS
            get-account-limit
          --type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --type (string)
          The limit that you want to get. Valid values include the following:

          o MAX_HEALTH_CHECKS_BY_OWNER  :  The maximum number of health checks
            that you can create using the current account.

          o MAX_HOSTED_ZONES_BY_OWNER : The maximum  number  of  hosted  zones
            that you can create using the current account.

          o MAX_REUSABLE_DELEGATION_SETS_BY_OWNER  : The maximum number of re-
            usable delegation sets that  you  can  create  using  the  current
            account.

          o MAX_TRAFFIC_POLICIES_BY_OWNER  :  The  maximum  number  of traffic
            policies that you can create using the current account.

          o MAX_TRAFFIC_POLICY_INSTANCES_BY_OWNER  :  The  maximum  number  of
            traffic  policy  instances  that  you can create using the current
            account. (Traffic policy instances are referred to as traffic flow
            policy records in the Amazon Route 53 console.)

          Possible values:

          o MAX_HEALTH_CHECKS_BY_OWNER

          o MAX_HOSTED_ZONES_BY_OWNER

          o MAX_TRAFFIC_POLICY_INSTANCES_BY_OWNER

          o MAX_REUSABLE_DELEGATION_SETS_BY_OWNER

          o MAX_TRAFFIC_POLICIES_BY_OWNER

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Limit -> (structure)
          The  current  setting  for  the specified limit. For example, if you
          specified MAX_HEALTH_CHECKS_BY_OWNER for the value of  Type  in  the
          request,  the  value of Limit is the maximum number of health checks
          that you can create using the current account.

          Type -> (string)
              The limit that you requested. Valid values include  the  follow-
              ing:

              o MAX_HEALTH_CHECKS_BY_OWNER  :  The  maximum  number  of health
                checks that you can create using the current account.

              o MAX_HOSTED_ZONES_BY_OWNER : The maximum number of hosted zones
                that you can create using the current account.

              o MAX_REUSABLE_DELEGATION_SETS_BY_OWNER  : The maximum number of
                reusable delegation sets that you can create using the current
                account.

              o MAX_TRAFFIC_POLICIES_BY_OWNER  : The maximum number of traffic
                policies that you can create using the current account.

              o MAX_TRAFFIC_POLICY_INSTANCES_BY_OWNER : The maximum number  of
                traffic policy instances that you can create using the current
                account. (Traffic policy instances are referred to as  traffic
                flow policy records in the Amazon Route 53 console.)

          Value -> (long)
              The current value for the limit that is specified by Type .

       Count -> (long)
          The  current  number of entities that you have created of the speci-
          fied type. For example, if you specified  MAX_HEALTH_CHECKS_BY_OWNER
          for the value of Type in the request, the value of Count is the cur-
          rent number of health checks that you have created using the current
          account.
