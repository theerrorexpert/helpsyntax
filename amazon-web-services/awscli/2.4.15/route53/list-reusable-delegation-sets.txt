NAME
       list-reusable-delegation-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list  of the reusable delegation sets that are associated
       with the current Amazon Web Services account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-reusable-delegation-sets
          [--marker <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --marker (string)
          If the value of IsTruncated in the previous response was true ,  you
          have  more  reusable  delegation  sets. To get another group, submit
          another ListReusableDelegationSets request.

          For the value of marker , specify the value of NextMarker  from  the
          previous  response, which is the ID of the first reusable delegation
          set that Amazon Route 53 will return if you submit another  request.

          If  the  value  of  IsTruncated in the previous response was false ,
          there are no more reusable delegation sets to get.

       --max-items (string)
          The number of reusable delegation sets that you want Amazon Route 53
          to  return  in  the response to this request. If you specify a value
          greater than 100, Route 53 returns only the first 100 reusable dele-
          gation sets.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DelegationSets -> (list)
          A  complex type that contains one DelegationSet element for each re-
          usable delegation set that was created by  the  current  Amazon  Web
          Services account.

          (structure)
              A  complex type that lists the name servers in a delegation set,
              as well as the CallerReference and the  ID  for  the  delegation
              set.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  ID that Amazon Route 53 assigns to a reusable delegation
                 set.

              CallerReference -> (string)
                 The value that you specified  for  CallerReference  when  you
                 created the reusable delegation set.

              NameServers -> (list)
                 A complex type that contains a list of the authoritative name
                 servers for a hosted zone or for a reusable delegation set.

                 (string)

       Marker -> (string)
          For the second and subsequent calls to ListReusableDelegationSets  ,
          Marker  is  the value that you specified for the marker parameter in
          the request that produced the current response.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there  are  more  reusable  delegation
          sets to be listed.

       NextMarker -> (string)
          If IsTruncated is true , the value of NextMarker identifies the next
          reusable delegation set that Amazon Route 53 will return if you sub-
          mit another ListReusableDelegationSets request and specify the value
          of NextMarker in the marker parameter.

       MaxItems -> (string)
          The value that you specified for the maxitems parameter in the  call
          to ListReusableDelegationSets that produced the current response.
