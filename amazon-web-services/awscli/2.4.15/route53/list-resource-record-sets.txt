LIST-RESOURCE-RECORD-SETS()                        LIST-RESOURCE-RECORD-SETS()



NAME
       list-resource-record-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the resource record sets in a specified hosted zone.
          ListResourceRecordSets  returns  up to 300 resource record sets at a
          time in ASCII order, beginning at a position specified by  the  name
          and type elements.

          Sort order

          ListResourceRecordSets  sorts  results  first  by  DNS name with the
          labels reversed, for example:

          com.example.www.

       Note the trailing dot, which can change the sort order when the  record
       name contains characters that appear before . (decimal 46) in the ASCII
       table. These characters include the following: ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * +  ,
       -

       When  multiple  records  have the same DNS name, ListResourceRecordSets
       sorts results by the record type.
          Specifying where to start listing records

       You can use the name and type elements to specify the  resource  record
       set that the list begins with:
          If you do not specify Name or Type

       The  results  begin  with the first resource record set that the hosted
       zone contains.
          If you specify Name but not Type

       The results begin with the first resource record set in the list  whose
       name is greater than or equal to Name .
          If you specify Type but not Name

       Amazon Route 53 returns the InvalidInput error.
          If you specify both Name and Type

       The  results begin with the first resource record set in the list whose
       name is greater than or equal to Name , and whose type is greater  than
       or equal to Type .
          Resource record sets that are PENDING

       This  action  returns  the  most  current  version of the records. This
       includes records that are PENDING , and that are not yet  available  on
       all Route 53 DNS servers.
          Changing resource record sets

       To  ensure that you get an accurate listing of the resource record sets
       for a hosted zone at a point in time, do not submit a ChangeResourceRe-
       cordSets  request  while you're paging through the results of a ListRe-
       sourceRecordSets request. If you do, some  pages  may  display  results
       without  the  latest changes while other pages display results with the
       latest changes.
          Displaying the next page of results

       If a ListResourceRecordSets command  returns  more  than  one  page  of
       results, the value of IsTruncated is true . To display the next page of
       results, get the values of NextRecordName , NextRecordType ,  and  Nex-
       tRecordIdentifier  (if  any)  from  the  response.  Then submit another
       ListResourceRecordSets  request,   and   specify   those   values   for
       StartRecordName , StartRecordType , and StartRecordIdentifier .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-resource-record-sets  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: ResourceRecordSets

SYNOPSIS
            list-resource-record-sets
          --hosted-zone-id <value>
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          The ID of the hosted zone that contains  the  resource  record  sets
          that you want to list.

       --max-items (string)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the resource record sets in a hosted zone

       The following list-resource-record-sets command lists summary  informa-
       tion  about  the  first  100 resource record sets in a specified hosted
       zone.:

          aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id Z2LD58HEXAMPLE

       If the hosted zone contains more than 100 resource record sets,  or  if
       you  want  to  list them in groups smaller than 100, include the --max-
       items parameter. For example, to list resource record  sets  one  at  a
       time, use the following command:

          aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id Z2LD58HEXAMPLE --max-items 1

       To  view  information  about the next resource record set in the hosted
       zone, take the value of NextToken from the  response  to  the  previous
       command, and include it in the --starting-token parameter, for example:

          aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id Z2LD58HEXAMPLE --max-items 1 --starting-token Z3M3LMPEXAMPLE

       To view all the resource record sets of  a  particular  name,  use  the
       --query parameter to filter them out. For example:

          aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id Z2LD58HEXAMPLE --query "ResourceRecordSets[?Name == 'example.domain.']"

OUTPUT
       ResourceRecordSets -> (list)
          Information about multiple resource record sets.

          (structure)
              Information about the resource record set to create or delete.

              Name -> (string)
                 For ChangeResourceRecordSets requests, the name of the record
                 that you want to  create,  update,  or  delete.  For  ListRe-
                 sourceRecordSets responses, the name of a record in the spec-
                 ified hosted zone.
                     ChangeResourceRecordSets Only

                 Enter a fully qualified domain name, for  example,  www.exam-
                 ple.com  .  You can optionally include a trailing dot. If you
                 omit the trailing dot,  Amazon  Route  53  assumes  that  the
                 domain  name  that you specify is fully qualified. This means
                 that Route 53 treats www.example.com (without a trailing dot)
                 and www.example.com. (with a trailing dot) as identical.

                 For  information  about  how to specify characters other than
                 a-z , 0-9 , and - (hyphen) and how to specify  international-
                 ized  domain  names, see DNS Domain Name Format in the Amazon
                 Route 53 Developer Guide .

                 You can use the asterisk (*) wildcard to replace the leftmost
                 label in a domain name, for example, *.example.com . Note the
                 following:

                 o The * must replace the entire label. For example, you can't
                   specify *prod.example.com or prod*.example.com .

                 o The  * can't replace any of the middle labels, for example,
                   marketing.*.example.com.

                 o If you include * in any position other  than  the  leftmost
                   label  in  a  domain  name, DNS treats it as an * character
                   (ASCII 42), not as a wildcard.

                 WARNING:
                     You can't use the * wildcard for  resource  records  sets
                     that have a type of NS.

                 You  can use the * wildcard as the leftmost label in a domain
                 name, for example, *.example.com . You can't use an * for one
                 of  the middle labels, for example, marketing.*.example.com .
                 In addition, the * must replace the entire label;  for  exam-
                 ple, you can't specify prod*.example.com .

              Type -> (string)
                 The  DNS  record type. For information about different record
                 types and how data is encoded for  them,  see  Supported  DNS
                 Resource  Record Types in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide
                 .

                 Valid values for basic resource record sets: A | AAAA | CAA |
                 CNAME | DS
                 |
                 MX | NAPTR | NS | PTR | SOA | SPF | SRV | TXT

                 Values  for  weighted,  latency,  geolocation,  and  failover
                 resource record sets: A | AAAA | CAA | CNAME | MX |  NAPTR  |
                 PTR  |  SPF  | SRV | TXT . When creating a group of weighted,
                 latency, geolocation, or failover resource record sets, spec-
                 ify the same value for all of the resource record sets in the
                 group.

                 Valid values for multivalue answer resource record sets: A  |
                 AAAA | MX | NAPTR | PTR | SPF | SRV | TXT

                 NOTE:
                     SPF  records were formerly used to verify the identity of
                     the sender of email messages. However, we no longer  rec-
                     ommend that you create resource record sets for which the
                     value of Type is SPF . RFC 7208, Sender Policy  Framework
                     (SPF)  for Authorizing Use of Domains in Email, Version 1
                     , has been updated to say, "...[I]ts existence and mecha-
                     nism defined in [RFC4408] have led to some interoperabil-
                     ity issues. Accordingly, its use is no longer appropriate
                     for SPF version 1; implementations are not to use it." In
                     RFC 7208, see section 14.1, The SPF DNS Record Type .

                 Values for alias resource record sets:

                 o Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and  edge-optimized
                   APIs:  A

                 o CloudFront  distributions:   A   If IPv6 is enabled for the
                   distribution, create two  resource  record  sets  to  route
                   traffic to your distribution, one with a value of A and one
                   with a value of AAAA .

                 o Amazon API Gateway environment that has a regionalized sub-
                   domain : A

                 o ELB load balancers:  A | AAAA

                 o Amazon S3 buckets:  A

                 o Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoints  A

                 o Another  resource  record  set in this hosted zone: Specify
                   the type of the resource record set  that  you're  creating
                   the alias for. All values are supported except NS and SOA .

                 NOTE:
                     If you're creating an alias record that has the same name
                     as  the  hosted  zone (known as the zone apex), you can't
                     route traffic to a record for which the value of Type  is
                     CNAME  .  This  is because the alias record must have the
                     same type as the record you're routing  traffic  to,  and
                     creating a CNAME record for the zone apex isn't supported
                     even for an alias record.

              SetIdentifier -> (string)
                     Resource record sets that have  a  routing  policy  other
                     than simple: An identifier that differentiates among mul-
                     tiple resource record sets that have the same combination
                     of  name  and  type,  such  as multiple weighted resource
                     record sets named acme.example.com that have a type of A.
                     In  a  group  of  resource record sets that have the same
                     name and type, the value of SetIdentifier must be  unique
                     for each resource record set.

                 For  information about routing policies, see Choosing a Rout-
                 ing Policy in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

              Weight -> (long)
                     Weighted resource record sets only: Among resource record
                     sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type,
                     a value that determines the  proportion  of  DNS  queries
                     that  Amazon  Route  53  responds  to  using  the current
                     resource record set. Route 53 calculates the sum  of  the
                     weights  for  the resource record sets that have the same
                     combination of DNS name and type. Route 53 then  responds
                     to  queries  based on the ratio of a resource's weight to
                     the total. Note the following:

                 o You must specify a value for the Weight element  for  every
                   weighted resource record set.

                 o You  can  only  specify  one  ResourceRecord  per  weighted
                   resource record set.

                 o You can't create latency, failover, or geolocation resource
                   record sets that have the same values for the Name and Type
                   elements as weighted resource record sets.

                 o You can create a maximum of 100  weighted  resource  record
                   sets  that  have the same values for the Name and Type ele-
                   ments.

                 o For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets,
                   if  you set Weight to 0 for a resource record set, Route 53
                   never responds to queries with  the  applicable  value  for
                   that  resource  record set. However, if you set Weight to 0
                   for all resource record sets that have the same combination
                   of  DNS  name  and type, traffic is routed to all resources
                   with equal probability. The effect of setting Weight  to  0
                   is different when you associate health checks with weighted
                   resource record sets. For more information, see Options for
                   Configuring   Route  53  Active-Active  and  Active-Passive
                   Failover in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

              Region -> (string)
                     Latency-based resource record sets only: The  Amazon  EC2
                     Region  where you created the resource that this resource
                     record set refers to. The resource typically is an Amazon
                     Web  Services resource, such as an EC2 instance or an ELB
                     load balancer, and is referred to by an IP address  or  a
                     DNS domain name, depending on the record type.

                 NOTE:
                     Although  creating  latency  and  latency  alias resource
                     record sets in a private hosted zone is allowed, it's not
                     supported.

                 When  Amazon  Route 53 receives a DNS query for a domain name
                 and type for which you have created latency  resource  record
                 sets,  Route  53 selects the latency resource record set that
                 has the lowest latency between the end user and  the  associ-
                 ated  Amazon EC2 Region. Route 53 then returns the value that
                 is associated with the selected resource record set.

                 Note the following:

                 o You  can  only  specify  one  ResourceRecord  per   latency
                   resource record set.

                 o You  can  only  create  one latency resource record set for
                   each Amazon EC2 Region.

                 o You aren't required to create latency resource record  sets
                   for all Amazon EC2 Regions. Route 53 will choose the region
                   with the best latency from among the regions that you  cre-
                   ate latency resource record sets for.

                 o You can't create non-latency resource record sets that have
                   the same values for the Name and Type elements  as  latency
                   resource record sets.

              GeoLocation -> (structure)
                     Geolocation  resource  record  sets  only: A complex type
                     that lets you control how Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS
                     queries  based on the geographic origin of the query. For
                     example, if you want all queries from Africa to be routed
                     to  a web server with an IP address of 192.0.2.111 , cre-
                     ate a resource record set with a Type of A and  a  Conti-
                     nentCode of AF .

                 NOTE:
                     Although   creating  geolocation  and  geolocation  alias
                     resource record sets in a private hosted zone is allowed,
                     it's not supported.

                 If  you  create separate resource record sets for overlapping
                 geographic regions (for example, one resource record set  for
                 a  continent  and  one  for a country on the same continent),
                 priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This  allows
                 you to route most queries for a continent to one resource and
                 to route queries for a country on that continent to a differ-
                 ent resource.

                 You  can't  create  two geolocation resource record sets that
                 specify the same geographic location.

                 The value * in the CountryCode element matches all geographic
                 locations that aren't specified in other geolocation resource
                 record sets that have the same values for the Name  and  Type
                 elements.

                 WARNING:
                     Geolocation  works  by mapping IP addresses to locations.
                     However, some IP addresses aren't  mapped  to  geographic
                     locations,  so  even  if  you create geolocation resource
                     record sets that cover all  seven  continents,  Route  53
                     will  receive  some  DNS  queries  from locations that it
                     can't identify. We recommend that you create  a  resource
                     record  set for which the value of CountryCode is * . Two
                     groups of queries are routed to  the  resource  that  you
                     specify  in this record: queries that come from locations
                     for which you haven't created geolocation resource record
                     sets  and queries from IP addresses that aren't mapped to
                     a location. If you don't create a * resource record  set,
                     Route  53 returns a "no answer" response for queries from
                     those locations.

                 You can't create non-geolocation resource  record  sets  that
                 have the same values for the Name and Type elements as geolo-
                 cation resource record sets.

                 ContinentCode -> (string)
                     The two-letter code for the continent.

                     Amazon Route 53 supports the following continent codes:

                     o AF : Africa

                     o AN : Antarctica

                     o AS : Asia

                     o EU : Europe

                     o OC : Oceania

                     o NA : North America

                     o SA : South America

                     Constraint: Specifying ContinentCode  with  either  Coun-
                     tryCode or SubdivisionCode returns an InvalidInput error.

                 CountryCode -> (string)
                     For geolocation resource record sets, the two-letter code
                     for a country.

                     Amazon  Route  53  uses the two-letter country codes that
                     are specified in ISO standard 3166-1 alpha-2 .

                 SubdivisionCode -> (string)
                     For geolocation resource record sets, the two-letter code
                     for  a  state of the United States. Route 53 doesn't sup-
                     port any other values for SubdivisionCode . For a list of
                     state  abbreviations, see Appendix B: TwoLetter State and
                     Possession Abbreviations on the United States Postal Ser-
                     vice website.

                     If you specify subdivisioncode , you must also specify US
                     for CountryCode .

              Failover -> (string)
                     Failover  resource  record  sets   only:   To   configure
                     failover,  you  add  the Failover element to two resource
                     record sets. For one resource  record  set,  you  specify
                     PRIMARY  as  the  value  for  Failover  ;  for  the other
                     resource record set, you specify SECONDARY . In addition,
                     you  include  the  HealthCheckId  element and specify the
                     health check that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform for
                     each resource record set.

                 Except  where  noted, the following failover behaviors assume
                 that you have included  the  HealthCheckId  element  in  both
                 resource record sets:

                 o When  the  primary resource record set is healthy, Route 53
                   responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from  the
                   primary resource record set regardless of the health of the
                   secondary resource record set.

                 o When the primary resource record set is unhealthy  and  the
                   secondary resource record set is healthy, Route 53 responds
                   to DNS queries with the applicable value from the secondary
                   resource record set.

                 o When  the secondary resource record set is unhealthy, Route
                   53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable  value  from
                   the primary resource record set regardless of the health of
                   the primary resource record set.

                 o If you omit the HealthCheckId  element  for  the  secondary
                   resource record set, and if the primary resource record set
                   is unhealthy, Route 53 always responds to DNS queries  with
                   the  applicable  value  from  the secondary resource record
                   set. This is true regardless of the health of  the  associ-
                   ated endpoint.

                 You  can't create non-failover resource record sets that have
                 the same values for the Name and Type  elements  as  failover
                 resource record sets.

                 For  failover  alias  resource  record  sets,  you  must also
                 include the EvaluateTargetHealth element and set the value to
                 true.

                 For more information about configuring failover for Route 53,
                 see the following topics in the  Amazon  Route  53  Developer
                 Guide :

                 o Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone

              MultiValueAnswer -> (boolean)
                     Multivalue  answer  resource  record sets only : To route
                     traffic approximately  randomly  to  multiple  resources,
                     such  as web servers, create one multivalue answer record
                     for each resource and specify true for MultiValueAnswer .
                     Note the following:

                 o If  you  associate  a health check with a multivalue answer
                   resource record  set,  Amazon  Route  53  responds  to  DNS
                   queries  with  the  corresponding  IP address only when the
                   health check is healthy.

                 o If you don't associate a health  check  with  a  multivalue
                   answer  record,  Route 53 always considers the record to be
                   healthy.

                 o Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to  eight  healthy
                   records;  if you have eight or fewer healthy records, Route
                   53 responds  to  all  DNS  queries  with  all  the  healthy
                   records.

                 o If  you  have  more  than  eight  healthy records, Route 53
                   responds to different DNS resolvers with different combina-
                   tions of healthy records.

                 o When  all  records  are unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS
                   queries with up to eight unhealthy records.

                 o If a resource becomes unavailable after a resolver caches a
                   response, client software typically tries another of the IP
                   addresses in the response.

                 You can't create multivalue answer alias records.

              TTL -> (long)
                 The resource record cache time to  live  (TTL),  in  seconds.
                 Note the following:

                 o If  you're  creating  or  updating an alias resource record
                   set, omit TTL . Amazon Route 53 uses the value of  TTL  for
                   the alias target.

                 o If  you're  associating  this  resource  record  set with a
                   health check (if you're adding a HealthCheckId element), we
                   recommend  that  you specify a TTL of 60 seconds or less so
                   clients respond quickly to changes in health status.

                 o All of the resource record sets  in  a  group  of  weighted
                   resource record sets must have the same value for TTL .

                 o If a group of weighted resource record sets includes one or
                   more weighted alias resource  record  sets  for  which  the
                   alias target is an ELB load balancer, we recommend that you
                   specify a TTL of  60  seconds  for  all  of  the  non-alias
                   weighted  resource  record sets that have the same name and
                   type. Values other than 60 seconds (the TTL for  load  bal-
                   ancers) will change the effect of the values that you spec-
                   ify for Weight .

              ResourceRecords -> (list)
                 Information about the resource records to act upon.

                 NOTE:
                     If you're creating an alias  resource  record  set,  omit
                     ResourceRecords .

                 (structure)
                     Information specific to the resource record.

                     NOTE:
                        If  you're creating an alias resource record set, omit
                        ResourceRecord .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The current or new DNS record  value,  not  to  exceed
                        4,000  characters.  In the case of a DELETE action, if
                        the current value does not match the actual value,  an
                        error  is returned. For descriptions about how to for-
                        mat Value for different record  types,  see  Supported
                        DNS  Resource  Record  Types  in  the  Amazon Route 53
                        Developer Guide .

                        You can specify more than one  value  for  all  record
                        types except CNAME and SOA .

                        NOTE:
                            If  you're  creating an alias resource record set,
                            omit Value .

              AliasTarget -> (structure)
                     Alias resource record sets only:  Information  about  the
                     Amazon  Web  Services resource, such as a CloudFront dis-
                     tribution or an Amazon S3 bucket, that you want to  route
                     traffic to.

                 If you're creating resource records sets for a private hosted
                 zone, note the following:

                 o You can't create an alias resource record set in a  private
                   hosted  zone to route traffic to a CloudFront distribution.

                 o Creating geolocation alias resource record sets or  latency
                   alias  resource  record  sets  in  a private hosted zone is
                   unsupported.

                     get   the   applicable   value   using  the  CLI  command
                     get-domain-names :

                     o For regional APIs, specify the value of regionalDomain-
                       Name .

                     o For edge-optimized APIs, specify the value of distribu-
                       tionDomainName . This is the  name  of  the  associated
                       CloudFront  distribution,  such  as  da1b2c3d4e5.cloud-
                       front.net .

                     NOTE:
                        The name of the record that you're creating must match
                        a  custom  domain name for your API, such as api.exam-
                        ple.com .

                        Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint

                     Enter the API endpoint for the interface  endpoint,  such
                     as vpce-123456789abcdef01-example-us-east-1a.elasticload-
                     balancing.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com .  For  edge-opti-
                     mized APIs, this is the domain name for the corresponding
                     CloudFront distribution. You can get the value of DnsName
                     using the CLI command describe-vpc-endpoints .
                        CloudFront distribution

                     Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you
                     created your distribution.

                     Your CloudFront distribution must  include  an  alternate
                     domain  name that matches the name of the resource record
                     set. For example, if the name of the resource record  set
                     is  acme.example.com  , your CloudFront distribution must
                     include acme.example.com as one of the  alternate  domain
                     names.  For  more information, see Using Alternate Domain
                     Names (CNAMEs) in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     You  can't  create  a  resource  record  set in a private
                     hosted zone to route traffic to  a  CloudFront  distribu-
                     tion.

                     NOTE:
                        For failover alias records, you can't specify a Cloud-
                        Front distribution for both the primary and  secondary
                        records.  A  distribution  must  include  an alternate
                        domain name that matches the name of the record.  How-
                        ever,  the primary and secondary records have the same
                        name, and you can't include the same alternate  domain
                        name in more than one distribution.

                        Elastic Beanstalk environment

                     If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk environment
                     includes the region that you deployed the environment in,
                     you can create an alias record that routes traffic to the
                     environment. For example,  the  domain  name  my-environ-
                     ment.*us-west-2*  .elasticbeanstalk.com is a regionalized
                     domain name.

                     WARNING:
                        For environments that were created before early  2016,
                        the  domain  name doesn't include the region. To route
                        traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME
                        record instead of an alias record. Note that you can't
                        create a CNAME record for the root  domain  name.  For
                        example,  if  your domain name is example.com, you can
                        create a record that  routes  traffic  for  acme.exam-
                        ple.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you
                        can't create a record that routes  traffic  for  exam-
                        ple.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

                     For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized
                     subdomains, specify the CNAME attribute for the  environ-
                     ment.  You can use the following methods to get the value
                     of the CNAME attribute:

                     o Amazon Web Services Management Console :  For  informa-
                       tion  about  how to get the value by using the console,
                       see Using Custom Domains with Elastic Beanstalk in  the
                       Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide .

                     o Elastic  Beanstalk  API  : Use the DescribeEnvironments
                       action to get the value of  the  CNAME  attribute.  For
                       more information, see DescribeEnvironments in the Elas-
                       tic Beanstalk API Reference .

                     o CLI : Use the describe-environments command to get  the
                       value of the CNAME attribute. For more information, see
                       describe-environments in the CLI Command Reference .

                       ELB load balancer

                     Specify the DNS name that is  associated  with  the  load
                     balancer.  Get  the DNS name by using the Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices Management Console, the ELB API, or the CLI.

                     o Amazon Web Services Management Console : Go to the  EC2
                       page,  choose  Load  Balancers  in the navigation pane,
                       choose the load balancer, choose the  Description  tab,
                       and  get  the  value  of the DNS name field.  If you're
                       routing traffic to a Classic  Load  Balancer,  get  the
                       value  that  begins  with dualstack . If you're routing
                       traffic to another type of load balancer, get the value
                       that applies to the record type, A or AAAA.

                     o Elastic  Load Balancing API : Use DescribeLoadBalancers
                       to get the value of DNSName . For more information, see
                       the applicable guide:

                       o Classic Load Balancers: DescribeLoadBalancers

                       o Application     and     Network    Load    Balancers:
                         DescribeLoadBalancers

                     o CLI : Use describe-load-balancers to get the  value  of
                       DNSName  .  For  more  information,  see the applicable
                       guide:

                       Global Accelerator accelerator

                     Specify the DNS name for your accelerator:

                     o Global  Accelerator  API:  To  get  the  DNS  name, use
                       DescribeAccelerator .

                     o CLI: To get the DNS name, use describe-accelerator .

                       Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a static website

                     Specify the domain name of the Amazon S3 website endpoint
                     that you created the  bucket  in,  for  example,  s3-web-
                     site.us-east-2.amazonaws.com . For more information about
                     valid values, see the table Amazon S3  Website  Endpoints
                     in  the  Amazon Web Services General Reference . For more
                     information about using  S3  buckets  for  websites,  see
                     Getting  Started with Amazon Route 53 in the Amazon Route
                     53 Developer Guide.
                        Another Route 53 resource record set

                     Specify the value of the  Name  element  for  a  resource
                     record set in the current hosted zone.

                     NOTE:
                        If  you're  creating an alias record that has the same
                        name as the hosted zone (known as the zone apex),  you
                        can't  specify  the domain name for a record for which
                        the value of Type is CNAME . This is because the alias
                        record  must  have  the  same  type as the record that
                        you're routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record
                        for  the  zone  apex isn't supported even for an alias
                        record.

                 EvaluateTargetHealth -> (boolean)
                        Applies only to  alias,  failover  alias,  geolocation
                        alias,  latency  alias,  and  weighted  alias resource
                        record sets: When EvaluateTargetHealth is  true  ,  an
                        alias  resource  record set inherits the health of the
                        referenced Amazon Web Services resource,  such  as  an
                        ELB  load  balancer  or another resource record set in
                        the hosted zone.

                     Note the following:
                        CloudFront distributions

                     You can't set EvaluateTargetHealth to true when the alias
                     target is a CloudFront distribution.
                        Elastic  Beanstalk environments that have regionalized
                        subdomains

                     If  you  specify  an  Elastic  Beanstalk  environment  in
                     DNSName  and  the  environment  contains an ELB load bal-
                     ancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to  the
                     healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the
                     load balancer. (An environment automatically contains  an
                     ELB load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon EC2
                     instance.) If you set EvaluateTargetHealth  to  true  and
                     either  no  Amazon  EC2 instances are healthy or the load
                     balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries  to
                     other available resources that are healthy, if any.

                     If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance,
                     there are no special requirements.
                        ELB load balancers

                     Health checking behavior depends on the type of load bal-
                     ancer:

                     o Classic  Load Balancers : If you specify an ELB Classic
                       Load Balancer  in  DNSName  ,  Elastic  Load  Balancing
                       routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances
                       that are registered with the load balancer. If you  set
                       EvaluateTargetHealth   to   true   and  either  no  EC2
                       instances are healthy or the load  balancer  itself  is
                       unhealthy,  Route 53 routes queries to other resources.

                     o Application and Network Load Balancers : If you specify
                       an ELB Application or Network Load Balancer and you set
                       EvaluateTargetHealth to true , Route 53 routes  queries
                       to  the load balancer based on the health of the target
                       groups that are associated with the load balancer:

                       o For an Application or Network  Load  Balancer  to  be
                         considered  healthy, every target group that contains
                         targets must contain at least one healthy target.  If
                         any target group contains only unhealthy targets, the
                         load balancer is considered unhealthy, and  Route  53
                         routes queries to other resources.

                       o A target group that has no registered targets is con-
                         sidered unhealthy.

                     NOTE:
                        When you create a load balancer,  you  configure  set-
                        tings   for  Elastic  Load  Balancing  health  checks;
                        they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a
                        similar function. Do not create Route 53 health checks
                        for the EC2 instances that you register  with  an  ELB
                        load balancer.

                        S3 buckets

                     There  are  no special requirements for setting Evaluate-
                     TargetHealth to true when  the  alias  target  is  an  S3
                     bucket.
                        Other records in the same hosted zone

                     If  the  Amazon Web Services resource that you specify in
                     DNSName is a record or a group of records (for example, a
                     group  of  weighted  records)  but  is  not another alias
                     record, we recommend that you associate  a  health  check
                     with  all  of  the  records in the alias target. For more
                     information,  see  What  Happens  When  You  Omit  Health
                     Checks? in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

                     For  more  information  and examples, see Amazon Route 53
                     Health Checks and DNS Failover in  the  Amazon  Route  53
                     Developer Guide .

              HealthCheckId -> (string)
                 If  you  want  Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record
                 set in response to a DNS query only  when  the  status  of  a
                 health  check  is  healthy, include the HealthCheckId element
                 and specify the ID of the applicable health check.

                 Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is  healthy
                 based on one of the following:

                 o By  periodically  sending a request to the endpoint that is
                   specified in the health check

                 o By aggregating the status of a specified  group  of  health
                   checks (calculated health checks)

                 o By  determining  the  current  state  of a CloudWatch alarm
                   (CloudWatch metric health checks)

                 WARNING:
                     Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint that is
                     specified  in  the  resource record set, for example, the
                     endpoint specified by the IP address in  the  Value  ele-
                     ment.  When you add a HealthCheckId element to a resource
                     record set, Route 53 checks the health  of  the  endpoint
                     that you specified in the health check.

                 For  more information, see the following topics in the Amazon
                 Route 53 Developer Guide :

                   Healthy

                 o Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover

                 o Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
                     When to Specify HealthCheckId

                 Specifying  a  value  for  HealthCheckId  is useful only when
                 Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets
                 to  respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the
                 choice in part on the status of a health  check.  Configuring
                 health  checks  makes  sense only in the following configura-
                 tions:

                 o Non-alias resource record sets : You're checking the health
                   of  a group of non-alias resource record sets that have the
                   same routing policy,  name,  and  type  (such  as  multiple
                   weighted  records  named  www.example.com with a type of A)
                   and you specify health  check  IDs  for  all  the  resource
                   record  sets.   If  the  health check status for a resource
                   record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the  record  among
                   the  records  that  it responds to DNS queries with. If the
                   health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy,
                   Route  53  stops  responding to DNS queries using the value
                   for that resource record set. If the  health  check  status
                   for  all  resource  record  sets in the group is unhealthy,
                   Route 53 considers all resource record sets  in  the  group
                   healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.

                 o Alias resource record sets : You specify the following set-
                   tings:

                   o You  set  EvaluateTargetHealth  to  true  for  an   alias
                     resource  record  set  in a group of resource record sets
                     that have the same routing policy, name, and  type  (such
                     as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a
                     type of A).

                   o You configure the alias  resource  record  set  to  route
                     traffic  to  a  non-alias resource record set in the same
                     hosted zone.

                   o You specify a health check ID for the non-alias  resource
                     record set.

                 If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the
                 alias resource record set to  be  healthy  and  includes  the
                 alias  record  among  the  records  that  it  responds to DNS
                 queries with.

                 If the health check  status  is  unhealthy,  Route  53  stops
                 responding  to  DNS  queries  using the alias resource record
                 set.

                 NOTE:
                        The alias resource record set can also  route  traffic
                        to a group of non-alias resource record sets that have
                        the same routing policy, name, and type. In that  con-
                        figuration,  associate  health  checks with all of the
                        resource  record  sets  in  the  group  of   non-alias
                        resource record sets.

                     Geolocation Routing

                 For  geolocation  resource  record  sets,  if  an endpoint is
                 unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record set  for  the
                 larger,  associated  geographic  region. For example, suppose
                 you have resource record sets  for  a  state  in  the  United
                 States,  for the entire United States, for North America, and
                 a resource record set that has * for CountryCode is * , which
                 applies  to  all  locations.  If  the  endpoint for the state
                 resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy
                 resource  record sets in the following order until it finds a
                 resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:

                 o The United States

                 o North America

                 o The default resource record set
                     Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name

                 If your health checks specify the  endpoint  only  by  domain
                 name,  we  recommend  that you create a separate health check
                 for each endpoint. For example, create  a  health  check  for
                 each  HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com
                 . For the value of  FullyQualifiedDomainName  ,  specify  the
                 domain  name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com
                 ), not the name of the resource record sets  (www.example.com
                 ).

                 WARNING:
                     Health  check results will be unpredictable if you do the
                     following:

                     o Create a health check that has the same value for  Ful-
                       lyQualifiedDomainName  as the name of a resource record
                       set.

                     o Associate that health check with  the  resource  record
                       set.

              TrafficPolicyInstanceId -> (string)
                 When  you  create  a traffic policy instance, Amazon Route 53
                 automatically creates a resource record set. TrafficPolicyIn-
                 stanceId  is the ID of the traffic policy instance that Route
                 53 created this resource record set for.

                 WARNING:
                     To delete the resource record set that is associated with
                     a  traffic  policy  instance,  use DeleteTrafficPolicyIn-
                     stance . Route 53 will delete  the  resource  record  set
                     automatically.  If  you delete the resource record set by
                     using ChangeResourceRecordSets , Route 53  doesn't  auto-
                     matically  delete the traffic policy instance, and you'll
                     continue to be charged for it even though it's no  longer
                     in use.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether more resource record sets remain to be
          listed. If your results were truncated, you  can  make  a  follow-up
          pagination request by using the NextRecordName element.

       NextRecordName -> (string)
          If  the  results  were truncated, the name of the next record in the
          list.

          This element is present only if IsTruncated is true.

       NextRecordType -> (string)
          If the results were truncated, the type of the next  record  in  the
          list.

          This element is present only if IsTruncated is true.

       NextRecordIdentifier -> (string)
              Resource  record sets that have a routing policy other than sim-
              ple: If results were truncated for a given DNS  name  and  type,
              the value of SetIdentifier for the next resource record set that
              has the current DNS name and type.

          For information about routing policies, see Choosing a Routing  Pol-
          icy in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

       MaxItems -> (string)
          The maximum number of records you requested.
