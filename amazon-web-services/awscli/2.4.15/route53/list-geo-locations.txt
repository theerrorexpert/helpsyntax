LIST-GEO-LOCATIONS()                                      LIST-GEO-LOCATIONS()



NAME
       list-geo-locations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a list of supported geographic locations.

       Countries  are  listed first, and continents are listed last. If Amazon
       Route 53 supports subdivisions for a country (for  example,  states  or
       provinces),  the subdivisions for that country are listed in alphabeti-
       cal order immediately after the corresponding country.

       Route 53 does  not  perform  authorization  for  this  API  because  it
       retrieves information that is already available to the public.

       For  a  list  of  supported geolocation codes, see the GeoLocation data
       type.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-geo-locations
          [--start-continent-code <value>]
          [--start-country-code <value>]
          [--start-subdivision-code <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --start-continent-code (string)
          The code for the continent with which  you  want  to  start  listing
          locations that Amazon Route 53 supports for geolocation. If Route 53
          has already returned a page or more of results,  if  IsTruncated  is
          true,  and  if  NextContinentCode  from  the previous response has a
          value, enter that value in startcontinentcode  to  return  the  next
          page of results.

          Include  startcontinentcode  only  if  you  want to list continents.
          Don't include startcontinentcode when you're  listing  countries  or
          countries with their subdivisions.

       --start-country-code (string)
          The  code for the country with which you want to start listing loca-
          tions that Amazon Route 53 supports for geolocation. If Route 53 has
          already returned a page or more of results, if IsTruncated is true ,
          and if NextCountryCode from the previous response has a value, enter
          that value in startcountrycode to return the next page of results.

       --start-subdivision-code (string)
          The  code  for the state of the United States with which you want to
          start listing locations that Amazon Route 53 supports  for  geoloca-
          tion. If Route 53 has already returned a page or more of results, if
          IsTruncated is true , and if NextSubdivisionCode from  the  previous
          response  has  a  value, enter that value in startsubdivisioncode to
          return the next page of results.

          To list subdivisions (U.S. states), you must include both startcoun-
          trycode and startsubdivisioncode .

       --max-items (string)
          (Optional)  The maximum number of geolocations to be included in the
          response body for this request. If more than  maxitems  geolocations
          remain  to  be  listed, then the value of the IsTruncated element in
          the response is true .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GeoLocationDetailsList -> (list)
          A complex type that contains one GeoLocationDetails element for each
          location that Amazon Route 53 supports for geolocation.

          (structure)
              A complex type that contains the codes and full continent, coun-
              try, and subdivision names for the specified geolocation code.

              ContinentCode -> (string)
                 The two-letter code for the continent.

              ContinentName -> (string)
                 The full name of the continent.

              CountryCode -> (string)
                 The two-letter code for the country.

              CountryName -> (string)
                 The name of the country.

              SubdivisionCode -> (string)
                 The code for the subdivision,  such  as  a  particular  state
                 within  the  United  States. For a list of US state abbrevia-
                 tions, see Appendix B: TwoLetter State and Possession  Abbre-
                 viations  on  the United States Postal Service website. For a
                 list  of   all   supported   subdivision   codes,   use   the
                 ListGeoLocations API.

              SubdivisionName -> (string)
                 The full name of the subdivision. Route 53 currently supports
                 only states in the United States.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether more locations remain  to  be  listed
          after  the  last  location  in  this  response.  If so, the value of
          IsTruncated is true . To get more values, submit another request and
          include  the  values  of  NextContinentCode  , NextCountryCode , and
          NextSubdivisionCode in the startcontinentcode ,  startcountrycode  ,
          and startsubdivisioncode , as applicable.

       NextContinentCode -> (string)
          If IsTruncated is true , you can make a follow-up request to display
          more locations. Enter the value of NextContinentCode in  the  start-
          continentcode parameter in another ListGeoLocations request.

       NextCountryCode -> (string)
          If IsTruncated is true , you can make a follow-up request to display
          more locations. Enter the value of NextCountryCode in the startcoun-
          trycode parameter in another ListGeoLocations request.

       NextSubdivisionCode -> (string)
          If IsTruncated is true , you can make a follow-up request to display
          more locations. Enter the value of NextSubdivisionCode in the start-
          subdivisioncode parameter in another ListGeoLocations request.

       MaxItems -> (string)
          The value that you specified for MaxItems in the request.
