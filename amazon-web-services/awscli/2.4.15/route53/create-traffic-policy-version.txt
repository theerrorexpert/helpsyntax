CREATE-TRAFFIC-POLICY-VERSION()                CREATE-TRAFFIC-POLICY-VERSION()



NAME
       create-traffic-policy-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new version of an existing traffic policy. When you create a
       new version of a traffic policy, you specify the ID of the traffic pol-
       icy  that  you  want  to  update  and  a  JSON-formatted  document that
       describes the new version. You use traffic policies to create  multiple
       DNS  resource  record sets for one domain name (such as example.com) or
       one subdomain name (such as www.example.com). You can create a  maximum
       of  1000  versions of a traffic policy. If you reach the limit and need
       to create another version, you'll need to start a new traffic policy.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-traffic-policy-version
          --id <value>
          --document <value>
          [--comment <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the traffic policy for which you want to create a new ver-
          sion.

       --document (string)
          The  definition  of this version of the traffic policy, in JSON for-
          mat.  You  specified  the  JSON  in  the  CreateTrafficPolicyVersion
          request.   For   more   information   about  the  JSON  format,  see
          CreateTrafficPolicy .

       --comment (string)
          The comment that you  specified  in  the  CreateTrafficPolicyVersion
          request, if any.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TrafficPolicy -> (structure)
          A  complex  type  that  contains settings for the new version of the
          traffic policy.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID that Amazon Route 53 assigned to a  traffic  policy  when
              you created it.

          Version -> (integer)
              The  version  number  that  Amazon Route 53 assigns to a traffic
              policy. For a new traffic policy, the value of Version is always
              1.

          Name -> (string)
              The name that you specified when you created the traffic policy.

          Type -> (string)
              The DNS type of the resource record sets that  Amazon  Route  53
              creates when you use a traffic policy to create a traffic policy
              instance.

          Document -> (string)
              The definition of a traffic policy in JSON format.  You  specify
              the JSON document to use for a new traffic policy in the Create-
              TrafficPolicy request. For more information about the JSON  for-
              mat, see Traffic Policy Document Format .

          Comment -> (string)
              The comment that you specify in the CreateTrafficPolicy request,
              if any.

       Location -> (string)
          A unique URL that represents a new traffic policy version.
