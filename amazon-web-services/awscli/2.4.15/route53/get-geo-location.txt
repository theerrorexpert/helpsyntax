GET-GEO-LOCATION()                                          GET-GEO-LOCATION()



NAME
       get-geo-location -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information about whether a specified geographic location is sup-
       ported for Amazon Route 53 geolocation resource record sets.

       Route 53 does  not  perform  authorization  for  this  API  because  it
       retrieves information that is already available to the public.

       Use  the following syntax to determine whether a continent is supported
       for geolocation:

          ``
          GET  /2013-04-01/geolocation?continentcode=*two-letter  abbreviation
          for a continent* ``

       Use  the  following  syntax to determine whether a country is supported
       for geolocation:

          ``
          GET /2013-04-01/geolocation?countrycode=*two-character country code*
          ``

       Use  the following syntax to determine whether a subdivision of a coun-
       try is supported for geolocation:

          ``
          GET /2013-04-01/geolocation?countrycode=*two-character country code*
          &subdivisioncode=*subdivision code* ``

SYNOPSIS
            get-geo-location
          [--continent-code <value>]
          [--country-code <value>]
          [--subdivision-code <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --continent-code (string)
          For geolocation resource record sets, a two-letter abbreviation that
          identifies a continent. Amazon Route 53 supports the following  con-
          tinent codes:

          o AF : Africa

          o AN : Antarctica

          o AS : Asia

          o EU : Europe

          o OC : Oceania

          o NA : North America

          o SA : South America

       --country-code (string)
          Amazon Route 53 uses the two-letter country codes that are specified
          in ISO standard 3166-1 alpha-2 .

       --subdivision-code (string)
          The code for the subdivision, such as a particular state within  the
          United States. For a list of US state abbreviations, see Appendix B:
          TwoLetter State and Possession Abbreviations on  the  United  States
          Postal  Service  website.  For  a  list of all supported subdivision
          codes, use the ListGeoLocations API.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GeoLocationDetails -> (structure)
          A complex type that contains the codes and full continent,  country,
          and subdivision names for the specified geolocation code.

          ContinentCode -> (string)
              The two-letter code for the continent.

          ContinentName -> (string)
              The full name of the continent.

          CountryCode -> (string)
              The two-letter code for the country.

          CountryName -> (string)
              The name of the country.

          SubdivisionCode -> (string)
              The  code for the subdivision, such as a particular state within
              the United States. For a list of  US  state  abbreviations,  see
              Appendix  B: TwoLetter State and Possession Abbreviations on the
              United States Postal Service website. For a  list  of  all  sup-
              ported subdivision codes, use the ListGeoLocations API.

          SubdivisionName -> (string)
              The  full  name  of the subdivision. Route 53 currently supports
              only states in the United States.
