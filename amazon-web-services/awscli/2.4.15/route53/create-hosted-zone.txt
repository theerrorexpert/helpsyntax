CREATE-HOSTED-ZONE()                                      CREATE-HOSTED-ZONE()



NAME
       create-hosted-zone -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new  public or private hosted zone. You create records in a
       public hosted zone to define how you  want  to  route  traffic  on  the
       internet  for  a  domain,  such  as  example.com,  and  its  subdomains
       (apex.example.com, acme.example.com). You create records in  a  private
       hosted  zone  to  define how you want to route traffic for a domain and
       its subdomains within one or more Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (Amazon
       VPCs).

       WARNING:
          You  can't  convert a public hosted zone to a private hosted zone or
          vice versa. Instead, you must create a new hosted zone with the same
          name and create new resource record sets.

       For  more  information about charges for hosted zones, see Amazon Route
       53 Pricing .

       Note the following:

       o You can't create a hosted zone for a top-level domain (TLD)  such  as
         .com.

       o For public hosted zones, Route 53 automatically creates a default SOA
         record and four NS records for the zone. For more  information  about
         SOA  and NS records, see NS and SOA Records that Route 53 Creates for
         a Hosted Zone in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide . If you want to
         use  the  same name servers for multiple public hosted zones, you can
         optionally associate a reusable delegation set with the hosted  zone.
         See the DelegationSetId element.

       o If  your  domain  is registered with a registrar other than Route 53,
         you must update the name servers with your registrar to make Route 53
         the  DNS  service for the domain. For more information, see Migrating
         DNS Service for an Existing Domain to Amazon Route 53 in  the  Amazon
         Route 53 Developer Guide .

       When  you  submit a CreateHostedZone request, the initial status of the
       hosted zone is PENDING . For public hosted zones, this means  that  the
       NS  and  SOA records are not yet available on all Route 53 DNS servers.
       When the NS and SOA records are  available,  the  status  of  the  zone
       changes to INSYNC .

       The   CreateHostedZone   request   requires   the  caller  to  have  an
       ec2:DescribeVpcs permission.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-hosted-zone
          --name <value>
          [--vpc <value>]
          --caller-reference <value>
          [--hosted-zone-config <value>]
          [--delegation-set-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the domain. Specify a fully qualified domain  name,  for
          example,  www.example.com  .  The  trailing  dot is optional; Amazon
          Route 53 assumes that the domain name is fully qualified. This means
          that  Route  53  treats www.example.com (without a trailing dot) and
          www.example.com. (with a trailing dot) as identical.

          If you're creating a public hosted zone, this is the name  you  have
          registered  with  your  DNS registrar. If your domain name is regis-
          tered with a registrar other than Route 53, change the name  servers
          for  your  domain  to  the  set of NameServers that CreateHostedZone
          returns in DelegationSet .

       --vpc (structure)
          (Private hosted zones only) A complex type that contains information
          about  the Amazon VPC that you're associating with this hosted zone.

          You can specify only one Amazon VPC when you create a private hosted
          zone.  If  you  are  associating  a VPC with a hosted zone with this
          request, the paramaters VPCId and VPCRegion are also required.

          To associate additional  Amazon  VPCs  with  the  hosted  zone,  use
          AssociateVPCWithHostedZone after you create a hosted zone.

          VPCRegion -> (string)
              (Private  hosted  zones  only) The region that an Amazon VPC was
              created in.

          VPCId -> (string)
              (Private hosted zones only) The ID of an Amazon VPC.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          VPCRegion=string,VPCId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "VPCRegion": "us-east-1"|"us-east-2"|"us-west-1"|"us-west-2"|"eu-west-1"|"eu-west-2"|"eu-west-3"|"eu-central-1"|"ap-east-1"|"me-south-1"|"us-gov-west-1"|"us-gov-east-1"|"us-iso-east-1"|"us-iso-west-1"|"us-isob-east-1"|"ap-southeast-1"|"ap-southeast-2"|"ap-southeast-3"|"ap-south-1"|"ap-northeast-1"|"ap-northeast-2"|"ap-northeast-3"|"eu-north-1"|"sa-east-1"|"ca-central-1"|"cn-north-1"|"af-south-1"|"eu-south-1",
            "VPCId": "string"
          }

       --caller-reference (string)
          A unique string that identifies the request and that  allows  failed
          CreateHostedZone  requests to be retried without the risk of execut-
          ing the operation twice.  You  must  use  a  unique  CallerReference
          string  every time you submit a CreateHostedZone request. CallerRef-
          erence can be any unique string, for example, a date/time stamp.

       --hosted-zone-config (structure)
          (Optional) A complex type that contains the following optional  val-
          ues:

          o For public and private hosted zones, an optional comment

          o For private hosted zones, an optional PrivateZone element

          If  you  don't  specify  a  comment or the PrivateZone element, omit
          HostedZoneConfig and the other elements.

          Comment -> (string)
              Any comments that you want to include about the hosted zone.

          PrivateZone -> (boolean)
              A value that indicates whether this is a private hosted zone.

       Note do not include PrivateZone in this input structure. Its  value  is
       returned in the output to the command.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Comment=string,PrivateZone=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Comment": "string",
            "PrivateZone": true|false
          }

       --delegation-set-id (string)
          If  you want to associate a reusable delegation set with this hosted
          zone, the ID that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the  reusable  delega-
          tion  set  when  you created it. For more information about reusable
          delegation sets, see CreateReusableDelegationSet .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a hosted zone

       The following create-hosted-zone command adds a hosted zone named exam-
       ple.com  using the caller reference 2014-04-01-18:47. The optional com-
       ment includes a space, so it must be enclosed in quotation marks:

          aws route53 create-hosted-zone --name example.com --caller-reference 2014-04-01-18:47 --hosted-zone-config Comment="command-line version"

       For more information, see Working with Hosted Zones in the Amazon Route
       53 Developer Guide.

              ServicePrincipal -> (string)
                 If the health check or hosted zone  was  created  by  another
                 service,  the  service  that  created  the  resource.  When a
                 resource is created by another service,  you  can't  edit  or
                 delete it using Amazon Route 53.

              GetChange action to get detailed information about the change.

          Status -> (string)
              The current state of the request. PENDING  indicates  that  this
              request  has  not  yet  been  applied to all Amazon Route 53 DNS
              servers.

          SubmittedAt -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the change request was submitted  in  ISO
              8601  format  and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example,
              the value 2017-03-27T17:48:16.751Z represents March 27, 2017  at
              17:48:16.751 UTC.
