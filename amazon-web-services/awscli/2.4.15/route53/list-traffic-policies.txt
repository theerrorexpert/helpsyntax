DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about the latest version for every traffic policy that
       is associated with the current Amazon Web  Services  account.  Policies
       are listed in the order that they were created in.

       For  information  about  how  of  deleting a traffic policy affects the
       response from ListTrafficPolicies , see DeleteTrafficPolicy .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-traffic-policies
          [--traffic-policy-id-marker <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --traffic-policy-id-marker (string)
          (Conditional) For your first request to ListTrafficPolicies ,  don't
          include the TrafficPolicyIdMarker parameter.

          If you have more traffic policies than the value of MaxItems , List-
          TrafficPolicies returns only the first MaxItems traffic policies. To
          get  the next group of policies, submit another request to ListTraf-
          ficPolicies . For the value of TrafficPolicyIdMarker ,  specify  the
          value  of  TrafficPolicyIdMarker  that  was returned in the previous
          response.

       --max-items (string)
          (Optional) The maximum number of traffic policies that you want Ama-
          zon Route 53 to return in response to this request. If you have more
          than MaxItems traffic policies, the  value  of  IsTruncated  in  the
          response  is true , and the value of TrafficPolicyIdMarker is the ID
          of the first traffic policy that Route 53 will return if you  submit
          another request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TrafficPolicySummaries -> (list)
          A list that contains one TrafficPolicySummary element for each traf-
          fic policy that was created  by  the  current  Amazon  Web  Services
          account.

          (structure)
              A  complex  type that contains information about the latest ver-
              sion of one traffic policy that is associated with  the  current
              Amazon Web Services account.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  ID  that  Amazon Route 53 assigned to the traffic policy
                 when you created it.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name that you specified for the traffic policy  when  you
                 created it.

              Type -> (string)
                 The DNS type of the resource record sets that Amazon Route 53
                 creates when you use a traffic policy  to  create  a  traffic
                 policy instance.

              LatestVersion -> (integer)
                 The  version number of the latest version of the traffic pol-
                 icy.

              TrafficPolicyCount -> (integer)
                 The number of traffic policies that are associated  with  the
                 current Amazon Web Services account.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A  flag that indicates whether there are more traffic policies to be
          listed. If the response was truncated, you can get the next group of
          traffic  policies  by submitting another ListTrafficPolicies request
          and specifying the value of TrafficPolicyIdMarker in the TrafficPol-
          icyIdMarker request parameter.

       TrafficPolicyIdMarker -> (string)
          If  the  value of IsTruncated is true , TrafficPolicyIdMarker is the
          ID of the first traffic policy in the next group of MaxItems traffic
          policies.

       MaxItems -> (string)
          The value that you specified for the MaxItems parameter in the List-
          TrafficPolicies request that produced the current response.
