NAME
       disassociate-vpc-from-hosted-zone -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociates an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) from an Ama-
       zon Route 53 private hosted zone. Note the following:

       o You can't disassociate the last Amazon  VPC  from  a  private  hosted
         zone.

       o You can't convert a private hosted zone into a public hosted zone.

       o You  can  submit a DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone request using either
         the account that created the hosted zone or the account that  created
         the Amazon VPC.

       o Some services, such as Cloud Map and Amazon Elastic File System (Ama-
         zon EFS) automatically create hosted zones and  associate  VPCs  with
         the  hosted  zones.  A  service  can  create a hosted zone using your
         account or using its own account. You can disassociate a VPC  from  a
         hosted  zone  only  if the service created the hosted zone using your
         account. When you run DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone , if  the  hosted
         zone  has  a  value  for  OwningAccount  ,  you  can use Disassociat-
         eVPCFromHostedZone . If the hosted zone has a value for OwningService
         , you can't use DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone .

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-vpc-from-hosted-zone
          --hosted-zone-id <value>
          --vpc <value>
          [--comment <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the private hosted zone that you want to disassociate a
          VPC from.

       --vpc (structure)
          A complex type that contains information about the VPC  that  you're
          disassociating from the specified hosted zone.

          VPCRegion -> (string)
              (Private  hosted  zones  only) The region that an Amazon VPC was
              created in.

          VPCId -> (string)
              (Private hosted zones only) The ID of an Amazon VPC.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          VPCRegion=string,VPCId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "VPCRegion": "us-east-1"|"us-east-2"|"us-west-1"|"us-west-2"|"eu-west-1"|"eu-west-2"|"eu-west-3"|"eu-central-1"|"ap-east-1"|"me-south-1"|"us-gov-west-1"|"us-gov-east-1"|"us-iso-east-1"|"us-iso-west-1"|"us-isob-east-1"|"ap-southeast-1"|"ap-southeast-2"|"ap-southeast-3"|"ap-south-1"|"ap-northeast-1"|"ap-northeast-2"|"ap-northeast-3"|"eu-north-1"|"sa-east-1"|"ca-central-1"|"cn-north-1"|"af-south-1"|"eu-south-1",
            "VPCId": "string"
          }

       --comment (string)
          Optional: A comment about the disassociation request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ChangeInfo -> (structure)
          A complex type that describes the changes made to the specified pri-
          vate hosted zone.

          Id -> (string)
              This  element  contains  an  ID  that  you use when performing a

          Status -> (string)
              The current state of the request. PENDING  indicates  that  this
