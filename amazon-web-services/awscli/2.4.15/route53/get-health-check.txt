GET-HEALTH-CHECK()                                          GET-HEALTH-CHECK()



NAME
       get-health-check -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a specified health check.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-health-check
          --health-check-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --health-check-id (string)
          The  identifier  that  Amazon  Route 53 assigned to the health check
          when you created it. When you add or update a resource  record  set,
          you  use  this value to specify which health check to use. The value
          can be up to 64 characters long.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a health check

       The following  get-health-check  command  gets  information  about  the
       health      check      that      has      a      health-check-id     of
       02ec8401-9879-4259-91fa-04e66d094674:

          aws route53 get-health-check --health-check-id 02ec8401-9879-4259-91fa-04e66d094674

OUTPUT
       HealthCheck -> (structure)
          A complex type that contains information about one health check that
          is associated with the current Amazon Web Services account.

          Id -> (string)
              The identifier that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the health check
              when you created it. When you add or update  a  resource  record
              set,  you  use  this value to specify which health check to use.
              The value can be up to 64 characters long.

          CallerReference -> (string)
              A unique string that you specified when you created  the  health
              check.

          LinkedService -> (structure)
              If  the health check was created by another service, the service
              that created the health check. When a health check is created by
              another  service, you can't edit or delete it using Amazon Route
              53.

              ServicePrincipal -> (string)
                 If the health check or hosted zone  was  created  by  another
                 service,  the  service  that  created  the  resource.  When a
                 resource is created by another service,  you  can't  edit  or
                 delete it using Amazon Route 53.

              Description -> (string)
                 If  the  health  check  or hosted zone was created by another
                 service, an optional description that can be provided by  the
                 other service. When a resource is created by another service,
                 you can't edit or delete it using Amazon Route 53.

          HealthCheckConfig -> (structure)
              A complex type that  contains  detailed  information  about  one
              health check.

              IPAddress -> (string)
                 The  IPv4  or  IPv6  IP address of the endpoint that you want
                 Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks  on.  If  you  don't
                 specify  a value for IPAddress , Route 53 sends a DNS request
                 to resolve the domain name that you  specify  in  FullyQuali-
                 fiedDomainName at the interval that you specify in RequestIn-
                 terval . Using an IP address returned by DNS, Route  53  then
                 checks the health of the endpoint.

                 Use one of the following formats for the value of IPAddress :

                 o IPv4 address : four values between 0 and 255, separated  by
                   periods (.), for example, 192.0.2.44 .

                 o IPv6  address  :  eight  groups of four hexadecimal values,
                   separated     by     colons     (:),      for      example,
                   2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345   .  You  can  also
                   shorten IPv6 addresses as described in RFC 5952, for  exam-
                   ple, 2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345 .

                 If  the  endpoint  is  an EC2 instance, we recommend that you
                 create an Elastic IP address,  associate  it  with  your  EC2
                 instance,  and specify the Elastic IP address for IPAddress .
                 This ensures that the IP address of your instance will  never
                 change.

                 For more information, see FullyQualifiedDomainName .

                 Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for
                 which the IP address is in local, private,  non-routable,  or
                 multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses for
                 which you can't create health checks, see the following docu-
                 ments:

                 o RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses

                 o RFC  6598,  IANA-Reserved  IPv4  Prefix  for Shared Address
                   Space

                 o RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses

                 When the value of Type is CALCULATED or  CLOUDWATCH_METRIC  ,
                 omit IPAddress .

              Port -> (integer)
                 The  port  on  the  endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to
                 perform health checks on.

                 NOTE:
                     Don't specify a value for Port when you specify  a  value
                     for Type of CLOUDWATCH_METRIC or CALCULATED .

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of health check that you want to create, which indi-
                 cates how Amazon Route 53 determines whether an  endpoint  is
                 healthy.

                 WARNING:
                     You  can't  change  the  value of Type after you create a
                     health check.

                 You can create the following types of health checks:

                 o HTTP : Route 53 tries to establish  a  TCP  connection.  If
                   successful,  Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for
                   an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

                 o HTTPS : Route 53 tries to establish a  TCP  connection.  If
                   successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for
                   an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

                 WARNING:
                     If you specify HTTPS for the value of Type , the endpoint
                     must support TLS v1.0 or later.

                 o HTTP_STR_MATCH  : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connec-
                   tion. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP  request  and
                   searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the
                   string that you specify in SearchString .

                 o HTTPS_STR_MATCH : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connec-
                   tion.  If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and
                   searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the
                   string that you specify in SearchString .

                 o TCP : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

                 o CLOUDWATCH_METRIC  :  The health check is associated with a
                   CloudWatch alarm. If the state of the alarm  is  OK  ,  the
                   health check is considered healthy. If the state is ALARM ,
                   the health check is  considered  unhealthy.  If  CloudWatch
                   doesn't have sufficient data to determine whether the state
                   is OK or ALARM , the health check  status  depends  on  the
                   setting   for   InsufficientDataHealthStatus  :  Healthy  ,
                   Unhealthy , or LastKnownStatus .

                 o CALCULATED : For health checks that monitor the  status  of
                   other  health checks, Route 53 adds up the number of health
                   checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy
                   and  compares that number with the value of HealthThreshold
                   .

                 o RECOVERY_CONTROL : The health check  is  assocated  with  a
                   Route53 Application Recovery Controller routing control. If
                   the routing control state is ON , the health check is  con-
                   sidered  healthy. If the state is OFF , the health check is
                   considered unhealthy.

                 For more information, see How Route 53 Determines Whether  an
                 Endpoint  Is Healthy in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

              ResourcePath -> (string)
                 The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route  53  to  request
                 when  performing health checks. The path can be any value for
                 which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or
                 3xx  when  the  endpoint  is  healthy,  for example, the file
                 /docs/route53-health-check.html. You can also  include  query
                 string    parameters,    for    example,   /welcome.html?lan-
                 guage=jp&login=y .

              FullyQualifiedDomainName -> (string)
                 Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on  whether  you  specify  a
                 value for IPAddress .
                     If you specify a value for  IPAddress :

                 Amazon  Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified
                 IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes the value of  FullyQualified-
                 DomainName  in  the  Host header for all health checks except
                 TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified  DNS
                 name  of  the  endpoint on which you want Route 53 to perform
                 health checks.

                 When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here  is  how
                 it constructs the Host header:

                 o If  you  specify  a  value  of  80  for  Port  and  HTTP or
                   HTTP_STR_MATCH for Type , Route 53 passes the value of Ful-
                   lyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.

                 o If  you  specify  a  value  of  443  for  Port and HTTPS or
                   HTTPS_STR_MATCH for Type , Route 53  passes  the  value  of
                   FullyQualifiedDomainName   to  the  endpoint  in  the  Host
                   header.

                 o If you specify another value for Port and any value  except
                   TCP  for  Type  ,  Route  53  passes  FullyQualifiedDomain-
                   Name:Port to the endpoint in the Host header.

                 If you don't specify a value for  FullyQualifiedDomainName  ,
                 Route  53  substitutes  the  value  of  IPAddress in the Host
                 header in each of the preceding cases.
                     If you don't specify a value for  IPAddress :

                 Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that  you  specify
                 for FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval that you specify
                 for RequestInterval . Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns,
                 Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     If  you  don't  specify  a value for IPAddress , Route 53
                     uses only IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint.  If
                     there's  no  resource record set with a type of A for the
                     name that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName ,  the
                     health  check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error.

                 If you want to check the  health  of  weighted,  latency,  or
                 failover  resource  record sets and you choose to specify the
                 endpoint only by FullyQualifiedDomainName , we recommend that
                 you  create  a  separate  health check for each endpoint. For
                 example, create a health check for each HTTP server  that  is
                 serving  content  for  www.example.com. For the value of Ful-
                 lyQualifiedDomainName , specify the domain name of the server
                 (such  as  us-east-2-www.example.com),  not  the  name of the
                 resource record sets (www.example.com).

                 WARNING:
                     In this configuration, if you create a health  check  for
                     which  the  value of FullyQualifiedDomainName matches the
                     name of the resource record sets and you  then  associate
                     the  health check with those resource record sets, health
                     check results will be unpredictable.

                 In addition, if the value that you specify for Type is HTTP ,
                 HTTPS , HTTP_STR_MATCH , or HTTPS_STR_MATCH , Route 53 passes
                 the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header,  as
                 it does when you specify a value for IPAddress . If the value
                 of Type is TCP , Route 53 doesn't pass a Host header.

              SearchString -> (string)
                 If the value of Type is HTTP_STR_MATCH or  HTTPS_STR_MATCH  ,
                 the string that you want Amazon Route 53 to search for in the
                 response body from the  specified  resource.  If  the  string
                 appears in the response body, Route 53 considers the resource
                 healthy.

                 Route 53 considers case when searching  for  SearchString  in
                 the response body.

              RequestInterval -> (integer)
                 The  number  of seconds between the time that Amazon Route 53
                 gets a response from your endpoint and the time that it sends
                 the  next  health check request. Each Route 53 health checker
                 makes requests at this interval.

                 WARNING:
                     You can't change the value of RequestInterval  after  you
                     create a health check.

                 If  you  don't  specify  a  value  for  RequestInterval , the
                 default value is 30 seconds.

              FailureThreshold -> (integer)
                 The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must
                 pass or fail for Amazon Route 53 to change the current status
                 of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa.  For
                 more  information, see How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether
                 an Endpoint Is Healthy in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide
                 .

                 If  you  don't  specify  a  value  for FailureThreshold , the
                 default value is three health checks.

              MeasureLatency -> (boolean)
                 Specify whether you want  Amazon  Route  53  to  measure  the
                 latency  between  health checkers in multiple Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices regions and your endpoint, and  to  display  CloudWatch
                 latency graphs on the Health Checks page in the Route 53 con-
                 sole.

                 WARNING:
                     You can't change the value of  MeasureLatency  after  you
                     create a health check.

              Inverted -> (boolean)
                 Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status
                 of a health check, for example, to consider  a  health  check
                 unhealthy when it otherwise would be considered healthy.

              Disabled -> (boolean)
                 Stops  Route  53 from performing health checks. When you dis-
                 able a health check, here's what happens:

                 o Health checks that check the health of endpoints: Route  53
                   stops  submitting  requests to your application, server, or
                   other resource.

                 o Calculated health checks: Route 53  stops  aggregating  the
                   status of the referenced health checks.

                 o Health  checks  that  monitor  CloudWatch  alarms: Route 53
                   stops monitoring the corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

                 After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the sta-
                 tus  of the health check to always be healthy. If you config-
                 ured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to the
                 corresponding  resources. If you want to stop routing traffic
                 to a resource, change the value of Inverted .

                 Charges for a health check still apply when the health  check
                 is  disabled. For more information, see Amazon Route 53 Pric-
                 ing .

              HealthThreshold -> (integer)
                 The number of child health checks that are associated with  a
                 CALCULATED  health  check  that Amazon Route 53 must consider
                 healthy for the CALCULATED  health  check  to  be  considered
                 healthy.  To specify the child health checks that you want to
                 associate  with  a   CALCULATED   health   check,   use   the
                 ChildHealthChecks element.

                 Note the following:

                 o If  you  specify  a number greater than the number of child
                   health checks, Route 53 always considers this health  check
                   to be unhealthy.

                 o If  you  specify  0 , Route 53 always considers this health
                   check to be healthy.

              ChildHealthChecks -> (list)
                 (CALCULATED Health Checks Only) A complex type that  contains
                 one  ChildHealthCheck  element for each health check that you
                 want to associate with a CALCULATED health check.

                 (string)

              EnableSNI -> (boolean)
                 Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of
                 FullyQualifiedDomainName  to the endpoint in the client_hello
                 message during TLS negotiation. This allows the  endpoint  to
                 respond  to  HTTPS  health check requests with the applicable
                 SSL/TLS certificate.

                 Some endpoints require that HTTPS requests include  the  host
                 name  in  the  client_hello message. If you don't enable SNI,
                 the status of the  health  check  will  be  SSL  alert  hand-
                 shake_failure  . A health check can also have that status for
                 other reasons. If SNI is enabled and you're still getting the
                 error,  check  the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint and
                 confirm that your certificate is valid.

                 The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint  includes  a  domain
                 name  in  the  Common Name field and possibly several more in
                 the Subject Alternative Names field. One of the domain  names
                 in  the  certificate  should match the value that you specify
                 for FullyQualifiedDomainName . If the  endpoint  responds  to
                 the  client_hello  message  with  a certificate that does not
                 include the domain name that you specified in FullyQualified-
                 DomainName  ,  a  health checker will retry the handshake. In
                 the second attempt, the health checker will omit  FullyQuali-
                 fiedDomainName from the client_hello message.

              Regions -> (list)
                 A  complex  type  that  contains  one Region element for each
                 region from which you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to
                 check the specified endpoint.

                 If  you  don't  specify any regions, Route 53 health checkers
                 automatically performs checks from all of  the  regions  that
                 are listed under Valid Values .

                 If you update a health check to remove a region that has been
                 performing health checks, Route 53 will briefly  continue  to
                 perform  checks  from  that region to ensure that some health
                 checkers are always checking the endpoint  (for  example,  if
                 you replace three regions with four different regions).

                 (string)

              AlarmIdentifier -> (structure)
                 A  complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you
                 want Amazon Route 53 health  checkers  to  use  to  determine
                 whether the specified health check is healthy.

                 Region -> (string)
                     For  the  CloudWatch  alarm that you want Route 53 health
                     checkers to use to determine whether this health check is
                     healthy, the region that the alarm was created in.

                     For  the  current  list of CloudWatch regions, see Amazon
                     CloudWatch endpoints and quotas in the  Amazon  Web  Ser-
                     vices General Reference .

                 Name -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon
                     Route 53 health checkers to use to determine whether this
                     health check is healthy.

                     NOTE:
                        Route 53 supports CloudWatch alarms with the following
                        features:

                        o Standard-resolution metrics. High-resolution metrics
                          aren't   supported.   For   more   information,  see
                          High-Resolution Metrics  in  the  Amazon  CloudWatch
                          User Guide .

                        o Statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, and Sam-
                          pleCount. Extended statistics aren't supported.

              InsufficientDataHealthStatus -> (string)
                 When CloudWatch has insufficient data  about  the  metric  to
                 determine  the  alarm  state, the status that you want Amazon
                 Route 53 to assign to the health check:

                 o Healthy :  Route  53  considers  the  health  check  to  be
                   healthy.

                 o Unhealthy  :  Route  53  considers  the  health check to be
                   unhealthy.

                 o LastKnownStatus : Route 53 uses the status  of  the  health
                   check  from  the  last  time that CloudWatch had sufficient
                   data to determine the alarm state. For  new  health  checks
                   that  have no last known status, the default status for the
                   health check is healthy.

              RoutingControlArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Route  53  Application
                 Recovery Controller routing control.

                 For more information about Route 53 Application Recovery Con-
                 troller, see Route 53 Application Recovery Controller  Devel-
                 oper Guide. .

          HealthCheckVersion -> (long)
              The  version  of  the health check. You can optionally pass this
              value in a call  to  UpdateHealthCheck  to  prevent  overwriting
              another change to the health check.

          CloudWatchAlarmConfiguration -> (structure)
              A  complex  type  that contains information about the CloudWatch
              alarm that Amazon Route 53 is monitoring for this health  check.

              EvaluationPeriods -> (integer)
                 For  the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with,
                 the number of periods that the  metric  is  compared  to  the
                 threshold.

              Threshold -> (double)
                 For  the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with,
                 the value the metric is compared with.

                 the duration of one evaluation period in seconds.

              MetricName -> (string)
                 The name of the CloudWatch metric that the alarm  is  associ-
                 ated with.

              Namespace -> (string)
                 The  namespace  of  the  metric  that the alarm is associated
                 with. For more information, see Amazon CloudWatch Namespaces,
                 Dimensions,  and  Metrics  Reference in the Amazon CloudWatch
