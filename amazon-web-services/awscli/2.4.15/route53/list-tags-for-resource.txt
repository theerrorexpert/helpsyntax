       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-tags-for-resource
          --resource-type <value>
          --resource-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-type (string)
          The type of the resource.

          o The resource type for health checks is healthcheck .

          o The resource type for hosted zones is hostedzone .

          Possible values:

          o healthcheck

          o hostedzone

       --resource-id (string)
          The ID of the resource for which you want to retrieve tags.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ResourceTagSet -> (structure)
          A ResourceTagSet  containing  tags  associated  with  the  specified
          resource.

          ResourceType -> (string)
              The type of the resource.

              o The resource type for health checks is healthcheck .

              o The resource type for hosted zones is hostedzone .

          ResourceId -> (string)
              The ID for the specified resource.

          Tags -> (list)
              The tags associated with the specified resource.

              (structure)
                 A complex type that contains information about a tag that you
                 want to add or edit for the specified health check or  hosted
                 zone.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  value  of Key depends on the operation that you want
                     to perform:

                     o Add a tag to a health check or hosted zone : Key is the
                       name that you want to give the new tag.

                     o Edit  a  tag : Key is the name of the tag that you want
                       to change the Value for.

                     o Delete a key : Key is the name of the tag you  want  to
                       remove.

                     o Give  a  name to a health check : Edit the default Name
                       tag. In the Amazon Route 53 console, the list  of  your
                       health  checks includes a Name column that lets you see
                       the name that you've given to each health check.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of Value depends on the operation that you want
                     to perform:

                     o Add  a  tag to a health check or hosted zone : Value is
                       the value that you want to give the new tag.

                     o Edit a tag : Value is the new value that  you  want  to
                       assign the tag.
