LIST-HOSTED-ZONES()                                        LIST-HOSTED-ZONES()



NAME
       list-hosted-zones -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a list of the public and private hosted zones that are asso-
       ciated with the current  Amazon  Web  Services  account.  The  response
       includes a HostedZones child element for each hosted zone.

       Amazon Route 53 returns a maximum of 100 items in each response. If you
       have a lot of hosted zones, you can use the maxitems parameter to  list
       them in groups of up to 100.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-hosted-zones  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: HostedZones

SYNOPSIS
            list-hosted-zones
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--delegation-set-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-items (string)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --delegation-set-id (string)
          If you're using reusable delegation sets and you want to list all of
          the hosted zones that are associated with a reusable delegation set,
          specify the ID of that reusable delegation set.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the hosted zones associated with the current AWS account

       The following list-hosted-zones command lists summary information about
       the first 100 hosted zones that are associated  with  the  current  AWS
       account.:

          aws route53 list-hosted-zones

       If  you have more than 100 hosted zones, or if you want to list them in
       groups smaller than 100, include the --max-items parameter.  For  exam-
       ple, to list hosted zones one at a time, use the following command:

          aws route53 list-hosted-zones --max-items 1

       To view information about the next hosted zone, take the value of Next-
       Token from the response to the previous command, and include it in  the
       --starting-token parameter, for example:

          aws route53 list-hosted-zones --max-items 1 --starting-token Z3M3LMPEXAMPLE

OUTPUT
       HostedZones -> (list)
          A  complex  type  that contains general information about the hosted
          zone.

          (structure)
              A complex type  that  contains  general  information  about  the
              hosted zone.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  ID that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the hosted zone when
                 you created it.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the domain. For public hosted zones, this is  the
                 name that you have registered with your DNS registrar.

                 For  information  about  how to specify characters other than
                 a-z , 0-9 , and - (hyphen) and how to specify  international-
                 ized domain names, see CreateHostedZone .

              CallerReference -> (string)
                 The  value  that  you  specified for CallerReference when you
                 created the hosted zone.

              Config -> (structure)
                 A complex type that includes the Comment and PrivateZone ele-
                 ments.  If  you omitted the HostedZoneConfig and Comment ele-
                 ments from the request, the Config and Comment elements don't
                 appear in the response.

                 Comment -> (string)
                     Any  comments  that  you want to include about the hosted
                     zone.

                 PrivateZone -> (boolean)
                     A value that indicates whether this is a  private  hosted
                     zone.

              ResourceRecordSetCount -> (long)
                 The number of resource record sets in the hosted zone.

              LinkedService -> (structure)
                 If  the  hosted zone was created by another service, the ser-
                 vice that created the hosted zone. When a hosted zone is cre-
                 ated  by  another  service, you can't edit or delete it using
                 Route 53.

                 ServicePrincipal -> (string)
                     If the health check or hosted zone was created by another
                     service,  the  service  that created the resource. When a
                     resource is created by another service, you can't edit or
                     delete it using Amazon Route 53.

                 Description -> (string)
                     If the health check or hosted zone was created by another
                     service, an optional description that can be provided  by
                     the  other service. When a resource is created by another
                     service, you can't edit or delete it using  Amazon  Route
                     53.

       Marker -> (string)
          For  the  second and subsequent calls to ListHostedZones , Marker is
          the value that you specified for the marker parameter in the request
          that produced the current response.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A  flag indicating whether there are more hosted zones to be listed.
          If the response was truncated, you can get more hosted zones by sub-
          mitting  another ListHostedZones request and specifying the value of
          NextMarker in the marker parameter.

       NextMarker -> (string)
          If IsTruncated is true , the  value  of  NextMarker  identifies  the
          first  hosted zone in the next group of hosted zones. Submit another
          ListHostedZones request, and specify the value  of  NextMarker  from
          the response in the marker parameter.

          This element is present only if IsTruncated is true .

       MaxItems -> (string)
          The  value that you specified for the maxitems parameter in the call
          to ListHostedZones that produced the current response.
