CHANGE-RESOURCE-RECORD-SETS()                    CHANGE-RESOURCE-RECORD-SETS()



NAME
       change-resource-record-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates,  changes,  or  deletes  a  resource record set, which contains
       authoritative DNS information for a specified domain name or  subdomain
       name.  For  example,  you  can use ChangeResourceRecordSets to create a
       resource record set that routes traffic for test.example.com to  a  web
       server that has an IP address of 192.0.2.44.
          Deleting Resource Record Sets

       To  delete  a resource record set, you must specify all the same values
       that you specified when you created it.
          Change Batches and Transactional Changes

       The request body must include a document with  a  ChangeResourceRecord-
       SetsRequest  element. The request body contains a list of change items,
       known as a change batch. Change batches  are  considered  transactional
       changes.  Route 53 validates the changes in the request and then either
       makes all or none of the changes in  the  change  batch  request.  This
       ensures that DNS routing isn't adversely affected by partial changes to
       the resource record sets in a hosted zone.

       For example, suppose a change batch request contains  two  changes:  it
       deletes  the  CNAME resource record set for www.example.com and creates
       an alias resource record set for  www.example.com.  If  validation  for
       both  records  succeeds, Route 53 deletes the first resource record set
       and creates the second resource record set in a  single  operation.  If
       validation  for  either the DELETE or the CREATE action fails, then the
       request is canceled, and the original CNAME record continues to  exist.

       NOTE:
              If you try to delete the same resource record set more than once
              in a single change batch, Route 53 returns an InvalidChangeBatch
              error.

          Traffic Flow

       To  create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use
       either the traffic flow visual editor in the Route 53  console  or  the
       API actions for traffic policies and traffic policy instances. Save the
       configuration as a traffic policy, then associate  the  traffic  policy
       with  one or more domain names (such as example.com) or subdomain names
       (such as www.example.com), in the  same  hosted  zone  or  in  multiple
       hosted  zones.  You  can roll back the updates if the new configuration
       isn't performing as expected. For more information, see  Using  Traffic
       Flow to Route DNS Traffic in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .
          Create, Delete, and Upsert

       Use ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest to perform the following actions:

       o CREATE : Creates a resource record set that has the specified values.

       o DELETE : Deletes an existing resource record set that has the  speci-
         fied values.

       o UPSERT  : If a resource record set does not already exist, Amazon Web
         Services creates it. If a resource set does exist, Route  53  updates
         it with the values in the request.
          Syntaxes for Creating, Updating, and Deleting Resource Record Sets

       The  syntax  for  a  request depends on the type of resource record set
       that you want to create, delete, or update, such as weighted, alias, or
       failover.  The  XML  elements  in your request must appear in the order
       listed in the syntax.

       For an example for each type of resource record set, see "Examples."

       Don't refer to the syntax in  the  "Parameter  Syntax"  section,  which
       includes all of the elements for every kind of resource record set that
       you can create, delete, or update by using ChangeResourceRecordSets .
          Change Propagation to Route 53 DNS Servers

       When you submit a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, Route 53 propagates
       your  changes  to  all of the Route 53 authoritative DNS servers. While
       your changes are propagating, GetChange returns a status of  PENDING  .
       When  propagation  is  complete, GetChange returns a status of INSYNC .
       Changes generally propagate to all Route 53 name servers within 60 sec-
       onds. For more information, see GetChange .
          Limits on ChangeResourceRecordSets Requests

       For information about the limits on a ChangeResourceRecordSets request,
       see Limits in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            change-resource-record-sets
          --hosted-zone-id <value>
          --change-batch <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          The ID of the hosted zone that contains  the  resource  record  sets
          that you want to change.

       --change-batch (structure)
          A  complex  type  that  contains an optional comment and the Changes
          element.

          Comment -> (string)
              Optional: Any comments you want to include about a change  batch
              request.

          Changes -> (list)
              Information about the changes to make to the record sets.

              (structure)
                 The information for each resource record set that you want to
                 change.

                 Action -> (string)
                     The action to perform:

                     o CREATE : Creates a resource record  set  that  has  the
                       specified values.

                     o DELETE : Deletes a existing resource record set.

                     WARNING:
                        To  delete  the resource record set that is associated
                        with    a     traffic     policy     instance,     use
                        DeleteTrafficPolicyInstance  .  Amazon  Route  53 will
                        delete the resource record set automatically.  If  you
                        delete  the  resource  record  set  by using ChangeRe-
                        sourceRecordSets  ,  Route  53  doesn't  automatically
                        delete  the  traffic  policy instance, and you'll con-
                        tinue to be charged for it even though it's no  longer
                        in use.

                     o UPSERT  :  If  a  resource  record  set doesn't already
                       exist, Route 53 creates it. If a  resource  record  set
                       does  exist, Route 53 updates it with the values in the
                       request.

                 ResourceRecordSet -> (structure)
                     Information about the  resource  record  set  to  create,
                     delete, or update.

                     Name -> (string)
                        For ChangeResourceRecordSets requests, the name of the
                        record that you want to create, update, or delete. For
                        ListResourceRecordSets responses, the name of a record
                        in the specified hosted zone.
                            ChangeResourceRecordSets Only

                        Enter a fully  qualified  domain  name,  for  example,
                        www.example.com  . You can optionally include a trail-
                        ing dot. If you omit the trailing dot, Amazon Route 53
                        assumes that the domain name that you specify is fully
                        qualified. This means that Route 53  treats  www.exam-
                        ple.com  (without a trailing dot) and www.example.com.
                        (with a trailing dot) as identical.

                        For information about how to specify characters  other
                        than  a-z  ,  0-9  , and - (hyphen) and how to specify
                        internationalized domain names, see  DNS  Domain  Name
                        Format in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

                        You  can  use the asterisk (*) wildcard to replace the
                        leftmost label in a domain name, for example,  *.exam-
                        ple.com . Note the following:

                        o The  *  must  replace the entire label. For example,
                          you can't specify *prod.example.com  or  prod*.exam-
                          ple.com .

                        o The  *  can't  replace any of the middle labels, for
                          example, marketing.*.example.com.

                        o If you include * in  any  position  other  than  the
                          leftmost label in a domain name, DNS treats it as an
                          * character (ASCII 42), not as a wildcard.

                        WARNING:
                            You can't use the * wildcard for resource  records
                            sets that have a type of NS.

                        You  can use the * wildcard as the leftmost label in a
                        domain name, for example, *.example.com  .  You  can't
                        use  an  *  for one of the middle labels, for example,
                        marketing.*.example.com .  In  addition,  the  *  must
                        replace the entire label; for example, you can't spec-
                        ify prod*.example.com .

                     Type -> (string)
                        The DNS record type. For information  about  different
                        record  types  and  how  data is encoded for them, see
                        Supported DNS Resource  Record  Types  in  the  Amazon
                        Route 53 Developer Guide .

                        Valid  values for basic resource record sets: A | AAAA
                        | CAA | CNAME | DS
                        |
                        MX | NAPTR | NS | PTR | SOA | SPF | SRV | TXT

                        Values  for  weighted,   latency,   geolocation,   and
                        failover  resource record sets: A | AAAA | CAA | CNAME
                        | MX | NAPTR | PTR | SPF | SRV | TXT . When creating a
                        group  of  weighted, latency, geolocation, or failover
                        resource record sets, specify the same value  for  all
                        of the resource record sets in the group.

                        Valid  values  for  multivalue  answer resource record
                        sets: A | AAAA | MX | NAPTR | PTR | SPF | SRV | TXT

                        NOTE:
                            SPF records were formerly used to verify the iden-
                            tity  of the sender of email messages. However, we
                            no  longer  recommend  that  you  create  resource
                            record  sets  for which the value of Type is SPF .
                            RFC 7208, Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Autho-
                            rizing  Use  of  Domains in Email, Version 1 , has
                            been updated to say, "...[I]ts existence and mech-
                            anism defined in [RFC4408] have led to some inter-
                            operability issues. Accordingly,  its  use  is  no
                            longer  appropriate for SPF version 1; implementa-
                            tions are not to use it." In RFC 7208, see section
                            14.1, The SPF DNS Record Type .

                        Values for alias resource record sets:

                        o Amazon   API   Gateway   custom  regional  APIs  and
                          edge-optimized APIs:  A

                        o CloudFront distributions:  A   If  IPv6  is  enabled
                          for  the  distribution,  create  two resource record
                          sets to route traffic to your distribution, one with
                          a value of A and one with a value of AAAA .

                        o Amazon  API Gateway environment that has a regional-
                          ized subdomain : A

                        o ELB load balancers:  A | AAAA

                        o Amazon S3 buckets:  A

                        o Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoints
                          A

                        o Another  resource  record  set  in this hosted zone:
                          Specify the type of the  resource  record  set  that
                          you're  creating  the alias for. All values are sup-
                          ported except NS and SOA .

                        NOTE:
                            If you're creating an alias record  that  has  the
                            same  name  as  the hosted zone (known as the zone
                            apex), you can't route traffic  to  a  record  for
                            which the value of Type is CNAME . This is because
                            the alias record must have the same  type  as  the
                            record  you're  routing traffic to, and creating a
                            CNAME record for the  zone  apex  isn't  supported
                            even for an alias record.

                     SetIdentifier -> (string)
                            Resource  record  sets  that have a routing policy
                            other than simple: An identifier that  differenti-
                            ates among multiple resource record sets that have
                            the same combination of name  and  type,  such  as
                            multiple   weighted  resource  record  sets  named
                            acme.example.com that have a type of A. In a group
                            of  resource  record  sets that have the same name
                            and type,  the  value  of  SetIdentifier  must  be
                            unique for each resource record set.

                        For information about routing policies, see Choosing a
                        Routing Policy in the Amazon Route 53 Developer  Guide
                        .

                     Weight -> (long)
                            Weighted resource record sets only: Among resource
                            record sets that have the same combination of  DNS
                            name and type, a value that determines the propor-
                            tion of DNS queries that Amazon Route 53  responds
                            to using the current resource record set. Route 53
                            calculates the sum of the weights for the resource
                            record  sets that have the same combination of DNS
                            name and type. Route 53 then responds  to  queries
                            based  on  the ratio of a resource's weight to the
                            total. Note the following:

                        o You must specify a value for the Weight element  for
                          every weighted resource record set.

                        o You can only specify one ResourceRecord per weighted
                          resource record set.

                        o You can't create latency, failover,  or  geolocation
                          resource  record  sets that have the same values for
                          the Name and  Type  elements  as  weighted  resource
                          record sets.

                        o You  can  create  a maximum of 100 weighted resource
                          record sets that have the same values for  the  Name
                          and Type elements.

                        o For  weighted  (but  not  weighted  alias)  resource
                          record sets, if you set Weight to 0 for  a  resource
                          record  set, Route 53 never responds to queries with
                          the applicable value for that resource  record  set.
                          However,  if  you  set  Weight to 0 for all resource
                          record sets that have the same  combination  of  DNS
                          name  and  type,  traffic is routed to all resources
                          with equal probability. The effect of setting Weight
                          to  0  is different when you associate health checks
                          with weighted resource record sets. For more  infor-

                     Region -> (string)
                            Latency-based  resource record sets only: The Ama-
                            zon EC2 Region where you created the resource that
                            this  resource  record set refers to. The resource
                            typically is an Amazon Web Services resource, such
                            as an EC2 instance or an ELB load balancer, and is
                            referred to by an IP address or a DNS domain name,
                            depending on the record type.

                        NOTE:
                            Although   creating   latency  and  latency  alias
                            resource record sets in a private hosted  zone  is
                            allowed, it's not supported.

                        When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for a domain
                        name and type  for  which  you  have  created  latency
                        resource  record  sets,  Route  53 selects the latency
                        resource  record  set  that  has  the  lowest  latency
                        between  the  end  user  and the associated Amazon EC2
                        Region. Route 53 then returns the value that is  asso-
                        ciated with the selected resource record set.

                        Note the following:

                        o You  can only specify one ResourceRecord per latency
                          resource record set.

                        o You can only create one latency resource record  set
                          for each Amazon EC2 Region.

                        o You  aren't  required  to  create  latency  resource
                          record sets for all Amazon  EC2  Regions.  Route  53
                          will  choose  the  region with the best latency from
                          among the regions that you create  latency  resource
                          record sets for.

                        o You  can't  create  non-latency resource record sets
                          that have the same values for the Name and Type ele-
                          ments as latency resource record sets.

                     GeoLocation -> (structure)
                            Geolocation  resource  record sets only: A complex
                            type that lets you control  how  Amazon  Route  53
                            responds  to  DNS  queries based on the geographic
                            origin of the query. For example, if you want  all
                            queries  from  Africa to be routed to a web server
                            with an IP  address  of  192.0.2.111  ,  create  a
                            resource  record set with a Type of A and a Conti-
                            nentCode of AF .

                        NOTE:
                            Although  creating  geolocation  and   geolocation
                            alias  resource  record  sets  in a private hosted
                            zone is allowed, it's not supported.

                        If you create separate resource record sets for  over-
                        lapping  geographic regions (for example, one resource
                        record set for a continent and one for  a  country  on
                        the  same  continent),  priority  goes to the smallest
                        geographic region.  This  allows  you  to  route  most
                        queries  for  a continent to one resource and to route
                        queries for a country on that continent to a different
                        resource.

                        You  can't create two geolocation resource record sets
                        that specify the same geographic location.

                        The value * in the  CountryCode  element  matches  all
                        geographic  locations  that  aren't specified in other
                        geolocation resource record sets that  have  the  same
                        values for the Name and Type elements.

                        WARNING:
                            Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to loca-
                            tions. However, some IP addresses aren't mapped to
                            geographic locations, so even if you create geolo-
                            cation resource record sets that cover  all  seven
                            continents, Route 53 will receive some DNS queries
                            from locations that it can't identify.  We  recom-
                            mend  that  you  create  a resource record set for
                            which the value of CountryCode is * .  Two  groups
                            of  queries  are  routed  to the resource that you
                            specify in this record:  queries  that  come  from
                            locations  for  which you haven't created geoloca-
                            tion resource record  sets  and  queries  from  IP
                            addresses that aren't mapped to a location. If you
                            don't create a * resource  record  set,  Route  53
                            returns  a  "no  answer" response for queries from
                            those locations.

                        You can't create non-geolocation resource record  sets
                        that  have  the same values for the Name and Type ele-
                        ments as geolocation resource record sets.

                        ContinentCode -> (string)
                            The two-letter code for the continent.

                            Amazon Route 53 supports the  following  continent
                            codes:

                            o AF : Africa

                            o AN : Antarctica

                            o AS : Asia

                            o EU : Europe

                            o OC : Oceania

                            o NA : North America

                            o SA : South America

                            Constraint:  Specifying  ContinentCode with either
                            CountryCode or SubdivisionCode returns an Invalid-
                            Input error.

                        CountryCode -> (string)
                            For geolocation resource record sets, the two-let-
                            ter code for a country.

                            Amazon Route 53 uses the two-letter country  codes
                            that  are specified in ISO standard 3166-1 alpha-2
                            .

                        SubdivisionCode -> (string)
                            For geolocation resource record sets, the two-let-
                            ter  code  for a state of the United States. Route
                            53 doesn't support any other values  for  Subdivi-
                            sionCode  . For a list of state abbreviations, see
                            Appendix B: TwoLetter State and Possession  Abbre-
                            viations  on the United States Postal Service web-
                            site.

                            If you specify subdivisioncode  ,  you  must  also
                            specify US for CountryCode .

                     Failover -> (string)
                            Failover  resource  record sets only: To configure
                            failover, you add  the  Failover  element  to  two
                            resource record sets. For one resource record set,
                            you specify PRIMARY as the value  for  Failover  ;
                            for  the  other  resource  record set, you specify
                            SECONDARY  .  In   addition,   you   include   the
                            HealthCheckId element and specify the health check
                            that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform for  each
                            resource record set.

                        Except  where  noted, the following failover behaviors
                        assume that you have included the  HealthCheckId  ele-
                        ment in both resource record sets:

                        o When  the  primary  resource  record set is healthy,
                          Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable
                          value  from  the primary resource record set regard-
                          less of the health of the secondary resource  record
                          set.

                        o When  the  primary  resource record set is unhealthy
                          and the secondary resource record  set  is  healthy,
                          Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable
                          value from the secondary resource record set.

                        o When the secondary resource record set is unhealthy,
                          Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable
                          value from the primary resource record  set  regard-
                          less  of  the  health of the primary resource record
                          set.

                        o If you omit the HealthCheckId element for  the  sec-
                          ondary  resource  record  set,  and  if  the primary
                          resource record set is unhealthy,  Route  53  always
                          responds  to  DNS  queries with the applicable value
                          from the secondary resource record set. This is true
                          regardless of the health of the associated endpoint.

                        You can't create  non-failover  resource  record  sets
                        that  have  the same values for the Name and Type ele-
                        ments as failover resource record sets.

                        For failover alias resource record sets, you must also
                        include  the  EvaluateTargetHealth element and set the
                        value to true.

                        For more information about  configuring  failover  for
                        Route 53, see the following topics in the Amazon Route

                     MultiValueAnswer -> (boolean)
                            Multivalue answer resource record sets only  :  To
                            route  traffic  approximately randomly to multiple
                            resources, such as web servers, create one  multi-
                            value  answer record for each resource and specify
                            true for MultiValueAnswer . Note the following:

                        o If you associate a health check  with  a  multivalue
                          answer resource record set, Amazon Route 53 responds
                          to DNS queries with  the  corresponding  IP  address
                          only when the health check is healthy.

                        o If  you don't associate a health check with a multi-
                          value answer record, Route 53 always  considers  the
                          record to be healthy.

                        o Route  53  responds  to DNS queries with up to eight
                          healthy records; if you have eight or fewer  healthy
                          records,  Route  53 responds to all DNS queries with
                          all the healthy records.

                        o If you have more than eight healthy  records,  Route
                          53  responds to different DNS resolvers with differ-
                          ent combinations of healthy records.

                        o When all records are unhealthy, Route 53 responds to
                          DNS queries with up to eight unhealthy records.

                        o If  a  resource becomes unavailable after a resolver
                          caches a response, client software  typically  tries
                          another of the IP addresses in the response.

                        You can't create multivalue answer alias records.

                     TTL -> (long)
                        The  resource record cache time to live (TTL), in sec-
                        onds. Note the following:

                        o If you're creating or  updating  an  alias  resource
                          record  set,  omit  TTL  .  Amazon Route 53 uses the
                          value of TTL for the alias target.

                        o If you're associating this resource record set  with
                          a  health  check  (if  you're adding a HealthCheckId
                          element), we recommend that you specify a TTL of  60
                          seconds  or  less  so  clients  respond  quickly  to
                          changes in health status.

                        o All of the  resource  record  sets  in  a  group  of
                          weighted  resource  record  sets  must have the same
                          value for TTL .

                        o If a group of weighted resource record sets includes
                          one  or more weighted alias resource record sets for
                          which the alias target is an ELB load  balancer,  we
                          recommend  that  you specify a TTL of 60 seconds for
                          all of the non-alias weighted resource  record  sets
                          that  have the same name and type. Values other than
                          60 seconds (the TTL for load balancers) will  change
                          the effect of the values that you specify for Weight
                          .

                     ResourceRecords -> (list)
                        Information about the resource records to act upon.

                        NOTE:
                            If you're creating an alias resource  record  set,
                            omit ResourceRecords .

                        (structure)
                            Information specific to the resource record.

                            NOTE:
                               If  you're  creating  an  alias resource record
                               set, omit ResourceRecord .

                            Value -> (string)
                               The current or new DNS  record  value,  not  to
                               exceed  4,000  characters.  In  the  case  of a
                               DELETE action, if the current  value  does  not
                               match  the  actual value, an error is returned.

                               and  secondary  records.  A  distribution  must
                               include  an  alternate domain name that matches
                               the name of the record.  However,  the  primary
                               and  secondary  records have the same name, and
                               you can't include  the  same  alternate  domain
                               name in more than one distribution.

                            the environment in, you can create an alias record
                            that routes traffic to the environment. For  exam-

                            name.

                            WARNING:
                               For environments that were created before early
                               2016,  the  domain  name  doesn't  include  the
                               region. To route traffic to these environments,
                               you must create a CNAME record  instead  of  an
                               alias  record.  Note  that  you  can't create a
                               CNAME record for  the  root  domain  name.  For
                               example,  if  your  domain name is example.com,
                               you can create a record that routes traffic for
                               acme.example.com   to  your  Elastic  Beanstalk
                               environment, but you can't create a record that
                               routes  traffic for example.com to your Elastic
                               Beanstalk environment.

                            For  Elastic  Beanstalk  environments  that   have
                            regionalized   subdomains,   specify   the   CNAME
                            attribute for the environment.  You  can  use  the
                            following  methods  to  get the value of the CNAME
                            attribute:

                              the EC2 page, choose Load Balancers in the navi-
                              gation pane, choose the  load  balancer,  choose
                              the  Description  tab,  and get the value of the
                              DNS name field.  If you're routing traffic to  a
                              Classic Load Balancer, get the value that begins
                              with dualstack . If you're  routing  traffic  to
                              another  type  of  load  balancer, get the value
                              that applies to the record type, A or AAAA.

                               Another Route 53 resource record set

                            Specify the  value  of  the  Name  element  for  a
                            resource record set in the current hosted zone.

                            NOTE:
                               If you're creating an alias record that has the
                               same name as the hosted zone (known as the zone
                               apex),  you can't specify the domain name for a
                               record for which the value of Type is  CNAME  .
                               This  is because the alias record must have the
                               same type as the  record  that  you're  routing
                               traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the
                               zone apex isn't supported  even  for  an  alias
                               record.

                        EvaluateTargetHealth -> (boolean)
                               Applies only to alias, failover alias, geoloca-
                               tion alias, latency alias, and  weighted  alias
                               resource record sets: When EvaluateTargetHealth
                               is true , an alias resource record set inherits
                               the  health  of  the referenced Amazon Web Ser-
                               vices resource, such as an ELB load balancer or
                               another resource record set in the hosted zone.

                            Note the following:
                               CloudFront distributions

                            You can't set EvaluateTargetHealth  to  true  when
                            the alias target is a CloudFront distribution.
                               Elastic   Beanstalk   environments   that  have
                               regionalized subdomains

                            If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in
                            DNSName  and  the environment contains an ELB load
                            balancer, Elastic Load  Balancing  routes  queries
                            only  to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are
                            registered with the load balancer. (An environment
                            automatically  contains an ELB load balancer if it
                            includes more than one Amazon  EC2  instance.)  If
                            you set EvaluateTargetHealth to true and either no
                            Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the load  bal-
                            ancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries
                            to other available resources that are healthy,  if
                            any.

                            If  the  environment  contains a single Amazon EC2
                            instance, there are no special requirements.
                               ELB load balancers

                            Health checking behavior depends on  the  type  of
                            load balancer:

                            o Classic  Load  Balancers : If you specify an ELB
                              Classic Load Balancer in DNSName , Elastic  Load
                              Balancing  routes  queries  only  to the healthy
                              Amazon EC2 instances that  are  registered  with
                              the  load  balancer. If you set EvaluateTargetH-
                              ealth to true and either no  EC2  instances  are
                              healthy   or   the   load   balancer  itself  is
                              unhealthy, Route  53  routes  queries  to  other
                              resources.

                            o Application  and Network Load Balancers : If you
                              specify an ELB Application or Network Load  Bal-
                              ancer and you set EvaluateTargetHealth to true ,
                              Route 53 routes queries  to  the  load  balancer
                              based  on  the  health of the target groups that
                              are associated with the load balancer:

                              o For an Application or Network Load Balancer to
                                be considered healthy, every target group that
                                contains targets must  contain  at  least  one
                                healthy  target.  If any target group contains
                                only unhealthy targets, the load  balancer  is
                                considered  unhealthy,  and  Route  53  routes
                                queries to other resources.

                              o A target group that has no registered  targets
                                is considered unhealthy.

                            NOTE:
                               When  you create a load balancer, you configure
                               settings  for  Elastic  Load  Balancing  health
                               checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but
                               they perform a similar function. Do not  create
                               Route  53  health  checks for the EC2 instances
                               that you register with an ELB load balancer.

                               S3 buckets

                            There are  no  special  requirements  for  setting
                            EvaluateTargetHealth to true when the alias target
                            is an S3 bucket.
                               Other records in the same hosted zone

                            If the Amazon Web Services resource that you spec-
                            ify  in  DNSName is a record or a group of records
                            (for example, a group of weighted records) but  is
                            not  another  alias  record, we recommend that you
                            associate a health check with all of  the  records
                            in  the  alias  target.  For more information, see
                            What Happens When You Omit Health Checks?  in  the
                            Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

                            For  more  information  and  examples,  see Amazon
                            Route 53 Health Checks and  DNS  Failover  in  the
                            Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

                     HealthCheckId -> (string)
                        If  you  want  Amazon Route 53 to return this resource
                        record set in response to a DNS query  only  when  the
                        status  of  a  health  check  is  healthy, include the
                        HealthCheckId element and specify the ID of the appli-
                        cable health check.

                        Route  53  determines whether a resource record set is
                        healthy based on one of the following:

                        o By periodically sending a request  to  the  endpoint
                          that is specified in the health check

                        o By  aggregating  the  status of a specified group of
                          health checks (calculated health checks)

                        o By determining the current  state  of  a  CloudWatch
                          alarm (CloudWatch metric health checks)

                        WARNING:
                            Route  53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint
                            that is specified in the resource record set,  for
                            example,  the endpoint specified by the IP address
                            in the Value element. When you add a HealthCheckId
                            element  to a resource record set, Route 53 checks
                            the health of the endpoint that you  specified  in
                            the health check.

                        For  more information, see the following topics in the
                        Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide :

                          Is Healthy

                        o Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
                            When to Specify HealthCheckId

                        Specifying  a  value  for HealthCheckId is useful only
                        when Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource
                        record  sets  to  respond to a DNS query, and you want
                        Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a
                        health  check.  Configuring  health checks makes sense
                        only in the following configurations:

                        o Non-alias resource record sets : You're checking the
                          health  of a group of non-alias resource record sets
                          that have the same routing policy,  name,  and  type
                          (such  as  multiple weighted records named www.exam-
                          ple.com with a type of A)  and  you  specify  health
                          check  IDs for all the resource record sets.  If the
                          health check status for a  resource  record  set  is
                          healthy,  Route  53  includes  the  record among the
                          records that it responds to DNS queries with. If the
                          health  check  status  for  a resource record set is
                          unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS  queries
                          using the value for that resource record set. If the
                          health check status for all resource record sets  in
                          the  group  is  unhealthy,  Route  53  considers all
                          resource  record  sets  in  the  group  healthy  and
                          responds to DNS queries accordingly.

                        o Alias resource record sets : You specify the follow-
                          ing settings:

                          o You set EvaluateTargetHealth to true for an  alias
                            resource  record set in a group of resource record
                            sets that have the same routing policy, name,  and
                            type  (such  as  multiple  weighted  records named
                            www.example.com with a type of A).

                          o You configure the alias  resource  record  set  to
                            route  traffic  to a non-alias resource record set
                            in the same hosted zone.

                          o You specify a health check ID  for  the  non-alias
                            resource record set.

                        If  the  health check status is healthy, Route 53 con-
                        siders the alias resource record set to be healthy and
                        includes  the  alias  record among the records that it
                        responds to DNS queries with.

                        If the health check  status  is  unhealthy,  Route  53
                        stops  responding  to  DNS  queries  using  the  alias
                        resource record set.

                        NOTE:
                               The alias resource record set  can  also  route
                               traffic to a group of non-alias resource record

                               and  type.  In  that  configuration,  associate
                               health checks with all of the  resource  record
                               sets  in the group of non-alias resource record

                            Geolocation Routing

                        For geolocation resource record sets, if  an  endpoint
                        is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record set
                        for the  larger,  associated  geographic  region.  For
                        example,  suppose  you have resource record sets for a
                        state in the United  States,  for  the  entire  United
                        States,  for  North America, and a resource record set
                        that has * for CountryCode is * , which applies to all
                        locations.  If  the  endpoint  for  the state resource
                        record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks  for  healthy
                        resource  record  sets in the following order until it
                        finds a resource record set for which the endpoint  is
                        healthy:

                        o The United States

                        o North America

                        o The default resource record set
                            Specifying  the  Health  Check  Endpoint by Domain
                            Name

                        If your health checks specify  the  endpoint  only  by
                        domain  name,  we recommend that you create a separate
                        health check for each endpoint. For example, create  a
                        health check for each HTTP server that is serving con-
                        tent for www.example.com . For the value of FullyQual-
                        ifiedDomainName  ,  specify  the  domain  name  of the
                        server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com ),  not  the
                        name of the resource record sets (www.example.com ).

                        WARNING:
                            Health  check results will be unpredictable if you
                            do the following:

                            o Create a health check that has  the  same  value
                              for  FullyQualifiedDomainName  as  the name of a
                              resource record set.

                            o Associate that health check  with  the  resource
                              record set.

                     TrafficPolicyInstanceId -> (string)
                        When  you  create  a  traffic  policy instance, Amazon
                        Route 53 automatically creates a resource record  set.
                        TrafficPolicyInstanceId  is the ID of the traffic pol-
                        icy instance  that  Route  53  created  this  resource
                        record set for.

                        WARNING:
                            To  delete the resource record set that is associ-
                            ated with a traffic policy instance,  use  Delete-
                            TrafficPolicyInstance  .  Route 53 will delete the
                            resource record set automatically. If  you  delete
                            the resource record set by using ChangeResourceRe-
                            cordSets , Route 53 doesn't  automatically  delete
                            the  traffic  policy instance, and you'll continue
                            to be charged for it even though it's no longer in
                            use.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To create, update, or delete a resource record set

       The  following  change-resource-record-sets  command creates a resource
       record set using the hosted-zone-id Z1R8UBAEXAMPLE and the JSON-format-
       ted            configuration            in           the           file
       C:\awscli\route53\change-resource-record-sets.json:

          aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id Z1R8UBAEXAMPLE --change-batch file://C:\awscli\route53\change-resource-record-sets.json

       For more information, see POST ChangeResourceRecordSets in  the  Amazon
       Route 53 API Reference.

       The  configuration  in  the  JSON  file depends on the kind of resource
       record set you want to create:
