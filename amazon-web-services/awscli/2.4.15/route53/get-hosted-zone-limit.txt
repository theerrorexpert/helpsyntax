SYNOPSIS
            get-hosted-zone-limit
          --type <value>
          --hosted-zone-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --type (string)
          The limit that you want to get. Valid values include the following:

          o MAX_RRSETS_BY_ZONE  :  The  maximum number of records that you can
            create in the specified hosted zone.

          o MAX_VPCS_ASSOCIATED_BY_ZONE : The maximum number  of  Amazon  VPCs
            that you can associate with the specified private hosted zone.

          Possible values:

          o MAX_RRSETS_BY_ZONE

          o MAX_VPCS_ASSOCIATED_BY_ZONE

       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          The ID of the hosted zone that you want to get a limit for.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Limit -> (structure)
          The  current  setting  for  the specified limit. For example, if you
          specified MAX_RRSETS_BY_ZONE for the value of Type in  the  request,
          the  value  of  Limit  is the maximum number of records that you can
          create in the specified hosted zone.

          Type -> (string)
              The limit that you requested. Valid values include  the  follow-
              ing:

              o MAX_RRSETS_BY_ZONE  :  The  maximum number of records that you
                can create in the specified hosted zone.

              o MAX_VPCS_ASSOCIATED_BY_ZONE : The  maximum  number  of  Amazon
                VPCs  that you can associate with the specified private hosted
                zone.

          Value -> (long)
              The current value for the limit that is specified by Type .

       Count -> (long)
          The current number of entities that you have created of  the  speci-
          fied  type. For example, if you specified MAX_RRSETS_BY_ZONE for the
          value of Type in the request, the value of Count is the current num-
          ber of records that you have created in the specified hosted zone.
