NAME
       update-traffic-policy-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  resource record sets in a specified hosted zone that were
       created based on the settings in a specified traffic policy version.

       When you update a traffic policy instance, Amazon Route 53 continues to
       respond  to  DNS queries for the root resource record set name (such as
       example.com) while it replaces one group of resource record  sets  with
       another. Route 53 performs the following operations:

       o Route  53  creates  a  new group of resource record sets based on the
         specified traffic policy. This is true regardless of how  significant
         the differences are between the existing resource record sets and the
         new resource record sets.

       o When all of the new resource record sets have been created, Route  53
         starts  to  respond  to  DNS queries for the root resource record set
         name (such as example.com) by using the new resource record sets.

       o Route 53 deletes the old group of resource record sets that are asso-
         ciated with the root resource record set name.

SYNOPSIS
            update-traffic-policy-instance
          --id <value>
          --ttl <value>
          --traffic-policy-id <value>
          --traffic-policy-version <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the traffic policy instance that you want to update.

       --ttl (long)
          The  TTL  that  you  want  Amazon  Route  53 to assign to all of the
          updated resource record sets.

       --traffic-policy-id (string)
          The ID of the traffic policy that you want Amazon Route 53 to use to
          update  resource  record  sets  for  the  specified  traffic  policy
          instance.

       --traffic-policy-version (integer)
          The version of the traffic policy that you want Amazon Route  53  to
          use  to update resource record sets for the specified traffic policy
          instance.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TrafficPolicyInstance -> (structure)
          A complex type that contains settings for the updated traffic policy
          instance.

          Id -> (string)
              The  ID  that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the new traffic policy
              instance.

          HostedZoneId -> (string)
              The ID of the hosted zone that Amazon Route 53 created  resource
              record sets in.

          Name -> (string)
              The DNS name, such as www.example.com, for which Amazon Route 53
              responds to queries by using the resource record sets  that  are
              associated with this traffic policy instance.

          TTL -> (long)
              The  TTL  that  Amazon  Route 53 assigned to all of the resource
              record sets that it created in the specified hosted zone.

          State -> (string)
              The value of State is one of the following values:
                 Applied

              Amazon Route 53 has finished creating resource record sets,  and
              changes have propagated to all Route 53 edge locations.
                 Creating

              Route  53  is  creating  the  resource record sets. Use GetTraf-
              ficPolicyInstance to  confirm  that  the  CreateTrafficPolicyIn-
              stance request completed successfully.
                 Failed

              Route  53  wasn't  able  to create or update the resource record
              sets. When the value of State is Failed ,  see  Message  for  an
              explanation of what caused the request to fail.

          Message -> (string)
              If  State is Failed , an explanation of the reason for the fail-
              ure. If State is another value, Message is empty.

          TrafficPolicyId -> (string)
              The ID of the traffic policy that Amazon Route 53 used to create
              resource record sets in the specified hosted zone.

          TrafficPolicyVersion -> (integer)
              The  version  of the traffic policy that Amazon Route 53 used to
              create resource record sets in the specified hosted zone.

              The DNS type that  Amazon  Route  53  assigned  to  all  of  the

              instance.
