INVOKE-ENDPOINT()                                            INVOKE-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       invoke-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       After you deploy a model into production using Amazon SageMaker hosting
       services, your client applications use this API to get inferences  from
       the model hosted at the specified endpoint.

       For an overview of Amazon SageMaker, see How It Works .

       Amazon  SageMaker strips all POST headers except those supported by the
       API. Amazon SageMaker might add additional headers. You should not rely
       on the behavior of headers outside those enumerated in the request syn-
       tax.

       Calls to InvokeEndpoint are authenticated by using Amazon Web  Services
       Signature Version 4. For information, see Authenticating Requests (Ama-
       zon Web Services Signature Version 4) in the Amazon S3 API Reference  .

       A  customer's  model containers must respond to requests within 60 sec-
       onds. The model itself can have a maximum processing time of 60 seconds
       before  responding to invocations. If your model is going to take 50-60
       seconds of processing time, the SDK socket timeout should be set to  be
       70 seconds.

       NOTE:
          Endpoints  are  scoped to an individual account, and are not public.
          The URL does not contain the account ID, but Amazon SageMaker deter-
          mines  the account ID from the authentication token that is supplied
          by the caller.

          [--content-type <value>]
          [--accept <value>]
          [--custom-attributes <value>]
          [--target-model <value>]

          [--target-container-hostname <value>]
          [--inference-id <value>]
          <outfile>

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-name (string)
          The name of the endpoint that you specified  when  you  created  the
          endpoint using the CreateEndpoint API.

       --body (blob)
          Provides  input  data,  in  the  format specified in the ContentType
          request header. Amazon SageMaker passes all of the data in the  body
          to the model.

          For  information  about  the  format of the request body, see Common
          Data Formats-Inference .

       --content-type (string)
          The MIME type of the input data in the request body.

       --accept (string)
          The desired MIME type of the inference in the response.

       --custom-attributes (string)
          Provides additional information about a  request  for  an  inference
          submitted  to  a  model  hosted at an Amazon SageMaker endpoint. The
          information is an opaque value that is forwarded verbatim. You could
          use  this  value,  for example, to provide an ID that you can use to
          track a request or to provide other metadata that a service endpoint
          was  programmed  to  process. The value must consist of no more than
          1024 visible US-ASCII characters  as  specified  in  Section  3.3.6.
          Field   Value   Components   of   the  Hypertext  Transfer  Protocol
          (HTTP/1.1).

          The code in your model is responsible for setting  or  updating  any
          custom  attributes  in  the response. If your code does not set this
          value in the response, an empty value is returned. For example, if a
          custom attribute represents the trace ID, your model can prepend the
          custom attribute with Trace ID: in your post-processing function.

          This feature is currently supported in the Amazon Web Services  SDKs
          but not in the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK.

       --target-model (string)
          The  model to request for inference when invoking a multi-model end-
          point.

       --target-variant (string)
          Specify the production variant to send the inference request to when
          invoking an endpoint that is running two or more variants. Note that
          this parameter overrides the  default  behavior  for  the  endpoint,
          which  is  to distribute the invocation traffic based on the variant
          weights.

          For information about how to use variant targeting  to  perform  a/b
          testing, see Test models in production

       --target-container-hostname (string)
          If  the  endpoint hosts multiple containers and is configured to use
          direct invocation, this parameter specifies the  host  name  of  the
          container to invoke.

       --inference-id (string)
          If  you  provide  a value, it is added to the captured data when you
          enable data capture on the endpoint. For information about data cap-
          ture, see Capture Data .

       outfile (string) Filename where the content will be saved

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Body -> (blob)
          Includes the inference provided by the model.

          For  information  about  the format of the response body, see Common
          Data Formats-Inference .

       ContentType -> (string)
          The MIME type of the inference returned in the response body.

       InvokedProductionVariant -> (string)
          Identifies the production variant that was invoked.

       CustomAttributes -> (string)
          Provides additional information in the response about the  inference
          returned  by  a  model  hosted  at an Amazon SageMaker endpoint. The
          information is an opaque value that is forwarded verbatim. You could
          use this value, for example, to return an ID received in the Custom-
          Attributes header of a request or other metadata that a service end-
          point  was  programmed to produce. The value must consist of no more
          than 1024 visible US-ASCII characters as specified in Section 3.3.6.
          Field   Value   Components   of   the  Hypertext  Transfer  Protocol
          (HTTP/1.1). If the customer wants the custom attribute returned, the
          model  must set the custom attribute to be included on the way back.

          The code in your model is responsible for setting  or  updating  any
          custom  attributes  in  the response. If your code does not set this
          value in the response, an empty value is returned. For example, if a
          custom attribute represents the trace ID, your model can prepend the
          custom attribute with Trace ID: in your post-processing function.

          This feature is currently supported in the Amazon Web Services  SDKs
          but not in the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK.
