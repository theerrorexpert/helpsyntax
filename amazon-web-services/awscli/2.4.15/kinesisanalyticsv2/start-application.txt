START-APPLICATION()                                        START-APPLICATION()



NAME
       start-application -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts the specified Kinesis Data Analytics application. After creating
       an application, you must exclusively call this operation to start  your
       application.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-application
          --application-name <value>
          [--run-configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The name of the application.

       --run-configuration (structure)
          Identifies  the  run  configuration  (start parameters) of a Kinesis
          Data Analytics application.

          FlinkRunConfiguration -> (structure)
              Describes the starting parameters for a Flink-based Kinesis Data
              Analytics application.

              AllowNonRestoredState -> (boolean)
                 When restoring from a snapshot, specifies whether the runtime
                 is allowed to skip a state that cannot be mapped to  the  new
                 program.  This  will happen if the program is updated between
                 snapshots to remove stateful parameters, and  state  data  in
                 the snapshot no longer corresponds to valid application data.
                 For more information, see Allowing Non-Restored State in  the
                 Apache Flink documentation .

                 NOTE:
                     This  value defaults to false . If you update your appli-
                     cation without  specifying  this  parameter,  AllowNonRe-
                     storedState  will be set to false , even if it was previ-
                     ously set to true .

          SqlRunConfigurations -> (list)
              Describes the starting parameters for a SQL-based  Kinesis  Data
              Analytics application application.

              (structure)
                 Describes  the  starting  parameters  for a SQL-based Kinesis
                 Data Analytics application.

                 InputId -> (string)
                     The input source ID. You can get this ID by  calling  the
                     DescribeApplication operation.

                 InputStartingPositionConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The point at which you want the application to start pro-
                     cessing records from the streaming source.

                     InputStartingPosition -> (string)
                        The starting position on the stream.

                        o NOW - Start  reading  just  after  the  most  recent
                          record in the stream, and start at the request time-
                          stamp that the customer issued.

                        o TRIM_HORIZON - Start reading at the  last  untrimmed
                          record  in  the  stream,  which is the oldest record
                          available in the stream. This option is  not  avail-
                          able  for  an  Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery
                          stream.

                        o LAST_STOPPED_POINT - Resume reading from  where  the
                          application last stopped reading.

          ApplicationRestoreConfiguration -> (structure)
              Describes the restore behavior of a restarting application.

              ApplicationRestoreType -> (string)
                 Specifies how the application should be restored.

              SnapshotName -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of an existing snapshot of application state
                 to use to restart an application. The application  uses  this
                 value  if  RESTORE_FROM_CUSTOM_SNAPSHOT  is specified for the
                 ApplicationRestoreType .

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FlinkRunConfiguration": {
              "AllowNonRestoredState": true|false
            },
            "SqlRunConfigurations": [
              {
                "InputId": "string",
                "InputStartingPositionConfiguration": {
                  "InputStartingPosition": "NOW"|"TRIM_HORIZON"|"LAST_STOPPED_POINT"
                }
              }
              ...
            ],
            "ApplicationRestoreConfiguration": {
              "ApplicationRestoreType": "SKIP_RESTORE_FROM_SNAPSHOT"|"RESTORE_FROM_LATEST_SNAPSHOT"|"RESTORE_FROM_CUSTOM_SNAPSHOT",
              "SnapshotName": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
