NAME
       add-application-reference-data-source -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds a reference data source to an existing SQL-based Kinesis Data Ana-
       lytics application.

       Kinesis Data Analytics reads reference data  (that  is,  an  Amazon  S3
       object) and creates an in-application table within your application. In
       the request, you provide the source (S3  bucket  name  and  object  key
       name),  name  of  the in-application table to create, and the necessary
       mapping information that describes how data in an Amazon S3 object maps
       to columns in the resulting in-application table.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            add-application-reference-data-source
          --application-name <value>
          --current-application-version-id <value>
          --reference-data-source <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The name of an existing application.

       --current-application-version-id (long)
          The  version  of the application for which you are adding the refer-
          ence data source. You can use the  DescribeApplication operation  to
          get the current application version. If the version specified is not
          the  current   version,   the   ConcurrentModificationException   is
          returned.

       --reference-data-source (structure)
          The reference data source can be an object in your Amazon S3 bucket.
          Kinesis Data Analytics reads the object and copies the data into the
          in-application  table  that  is  created.  You provide an S3 bucket,
          object key name, and the resulting in-application table that is cre-
          ated.

          TableName -> (string)
              The name of the in-application table to create.

          S3ReferenceDataSource -> (structure)
              Identifies  the S3 bucket and object that contains the reference
              data. A Kinesis Data Analytics application loads reference  data
              only  once. If the data changes, you call the  UpdateApplication
              operation to trigger reloading of data into your application.

              BucketARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the S3 bucket.

              FileKey -> (string)
                 The object key name containing the reference data.

          ReferenceSchema -> (structure)
              Describes the format of the data in the  streaming  source,  and
              how  each  data element maps to corresponding columns created in
              the in-application stream.

              RecordFormat -> (structure)
                 Specifies the format of the records on the streaming  source.

                 RecordFormatType -> (string)
                     The type of record format.

                 MappingParameters -> (structure)
                     When  you configure application input at the time of cre-
                     ating or updating  an  application,  provides  additional
                     mapping  information  specific to the record format (such
                     as JSON, CSV, or record fields delimited by  some  delim-
                     iter) on the streaming source.

                     JSONMappingParameters -> (structure)
                        Provides  additional  mapping information when JSON is
                        the record format on the streaming source.

                        RecordRowPath -> (string)
                            The path to the top-level parent that contains the
                            records.

                     CSVMappingParameters -> (structure)
                        Provides   additional  mapping  information  when  the
                        record format uses delimiters (for example, CSV).

                        RecordRowDelimiter -> (string)
                            The row delimiter. For example, in a  CSV  format,
                            'n' is the typical row delimiter.

                        RecordColumnDelimiter -> (string)
                            The  column  delimiter. For example, in a CSV for-
                            mat, a comma (",") is the  typical  column  delim-
                            iter.

              RecordEncoding -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  encoding  of  the  records  in  the streaming
                 source. For example, UTF-8.

              RecordColumns -> (list)
                 A list of RecordColumn objects.

                     For  a  SQL-based  Kinesis  Data  Analytics  application,
                     describes the mapping of each data element in the stream-
                     ing source to the corresponding column in the in-applica-
                     tion stream.

                     Also  used  to  describe the format of the reference data
                     source.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the  column  that  is  created  in  the
                        in-application input stream or reference table.

                     Mapping -> (string)
                        A reference to the data element in the streaming input
                        or the reference data source.

                     SqlType -> (string)
                        The type of column created in the in-application input
                        stream or reference table.

          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
