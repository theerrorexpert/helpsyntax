LIST-APPLICATION-VERSIONS()                        LIST-APPLICATION-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-application-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  the  versions for the specified application, including ver-
       sions that were rolled back. The response also includes  a  summary  of
       the configuration associated with each version.

       To  get  the  complete  description  of a specific application version,
       invoke the  DescribeApplicationVersion operation.

       NOTE:
          This operation is supported only for Amazon Kinesis  Data  Analytics
          for Apache Flink.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-application-versions
          --application-name <value>
          [--limit <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The name of the application for which you want to list all versions.

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of versions to list in  this  invocation  of  the
          operation.

       --next-token (string)
          If  a  previous  invocation  of this operation returned a pagination
          token, pass it into this value to retrieve the next set of  results.
          For  more information about pagination, see Using the Amazon Command
          Line Interface's Pagination Options .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ApplicationVersionSummaries -> (list)
          A list of the application versions and the associated  configuration
          summaries.  The  list includes application versions that were rolled
          back.

          To get the complete description of a specific  application  version,
          invoke the  DescribeApplicationVersion operation.

          (structure)
              The summary of the application version.

              ApplicationVersionId -> (long)
                 The  ID  of  the  application version. Kinesis Data Analytics
                 updates the ApplicationVersionId each  time  you  update  the
                 application.

              ApplicationStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the application.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  pagination  token for the next set of results, or null if there
          are no additional results. To retrieve the next set of  items,  pass
          this  token into a subsequent invocation of this operation. For more
          information about pagination, see  Using  the  Amazon  Command  Line
          Interface's Pagination Options .
