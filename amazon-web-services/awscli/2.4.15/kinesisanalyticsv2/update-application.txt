NAME
       update-application -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  an  existing  Kinesis  Data  Analytics application. Using this
       operation, you can update application code,  input  configuration,  and
       output configuration.

       Kinesis  Data  Analytics updates the ApplicationVersionId each time you
       update your application.

       NOTE:
          You cannot update the RuntimeEnvironment of an existing application.
          If you need to update an application's RuntimeEnvironment , you must
          delete the application and create it again.

                     an  application can perform. If AutoScalingEnabled is set
                     to True, then Kinesis Data  Analytics  can  increase  the
                     CurrentParallelism value in response to application load.
                     The service can increase  CurrentParallelism  up  to  the
                     maximum parallelism, which is ParalellismPerKPU times the

              AllowNonRestoredState -> (boolean)
                 When restoring from a snapshot, specifies whether the runtime
                 is allowed to skip a state that cannot be mapped to  the  new
                 program.  This  will happen if the program is updated between
                 snapshots to remove stateful parameters, and  state  data  in
                 the snapshot no longer corresponds to valid application data.
                 For more information, see Allowing Non-Restored State in  the
                 Apache Flink documentation .

                 NOTE:
                     This  value defaults to false . If you update your appli-
                     cation without  specifying  this  parameter,  AllowNonRe-
                     storedState  will be set to false , even if it was previ-
                     ously set to true .

          ApplicationRestoreConfiguration -> (structure)
              Describes updates to the restore behavior of a restarting appli-
              cation.

                 Specifies how the application should be restored.

              SnapshotName -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of an existing snapshot of application state
                 to use to restart an application. The application  uses  this
                 value  if  RESTORE_FROM_CUSTOM_SNAPSHOT  is specified for the
                 ApplicationRestoreType .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          action. To add a new CloudWatch logging option, use  AddApplication-
          CloudWatchLoggingOption .

          (structure)
              Describes the Amazon CloudWatch logging option updates.

              CloudWatchLoggingOptionId -> (string)

              LogStreamARNUpdate -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the CloudWatch log to
                 receive application messages.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CloudWatchLoggingOptionId=string,LogStreamARNUpdate=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          ]

       --conditional-token (string)
          A value you use to  implement  strong  concurrency  for  application
          updates.  You  must  provide  the CurrentApplicationVersionId or the
          ConditionalToken . You get the application's current  ConditionalTo-
          ken using  DescribeApplication . For better concurrency support, use
          the ConditionalToken  parameter  instead  of  CurrentApplicationVer-
          sionId .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     ConfigurationType -> (string)
                        Describes whether the  application  uses  the  default
                        parallelism for the Kinesis Data Analytics service.

                     Parallelism -> (integer)
                        Describes  the initial number of parallel tasks that a
                        Flink-based Kinesis  Data  Analytics  application  can
                        perform.  If  AutoScalingEnabled  is set to True, then
                        Kinesis Data Analytics can increase the  CurrentParal-
                        lelism value in response to application load. The ser-
                        vice can increase CurrentParallelism up to the maximum
                        parallelism, which is ParalellismPerKPU times the max-
                        imum KPUs for the application. The maximum KPUs for an
                        application  is 32 by default, and can be increased by
                        requesting a limit increase. If  application  load  is
                        reduced, the service can reduce the CurrentParallelism
                        value down to the Parallelism setting.

                     ParallelismPerKPU -> (integer)
                        Describes  the  number  of  parallel  tasks   that   a
                        Flink-based  Kinesis  Data  Analytics  application can
                        perform per Kinesis Processing Unit (KPU) used by  the
                        application.

                     CurrentParallelism -> (integer)
                        Describes  the current number of parallel tasks that a
                        Flink-based Kinesis  Data  Analytics  application  can
                        perform. If AutoScalingEnabled is set to True, Kinesis
                        Data Analytics can increase this value in response  to
                        application  load. The service can increase this value
                        up to the maximum parallelism, which  is  Paralellism-
                        PerKPU times the maximum KPUs for the application. The
                        maximum KPUs for an application is 32 by default,  and
                        can  be  increased  by requesting a limit increase. If
                        application load is reduced, the  service  can  reduce
                        the  CurrentParallelism  value down to the Parallelism
                        setting.

                     AutoScalingEnabled -> (boolean)
                        Describes whether the Kinesis Data  Analytics  service
                        can  increase  the  parallelism  of the application in
                        response to increased throughput.
