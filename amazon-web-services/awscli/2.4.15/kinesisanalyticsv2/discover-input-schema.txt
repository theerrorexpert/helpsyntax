DISCOVER-INPUT-SCHEMA()                                DISCOVER-INPUT-SCHEMA()



NAME
       discover-input-schema -

DESCRIPTION
       Infers  a  schema for a SQL-based Kinesis Data Analytics application by
       evaluating sample records on the specified  streaming  source  (Kinesis
       data  stream  or  Kinesis  Data  Firehose delivery stream) or Amazon S3
       object. In the response, the operation returns the inferred schema  and
       also the sample records that the operation used to infer the schema.

       You can use the inferred schema when configuring a streaming source for
       your application. When you create an application using the Kinesis Data
       Analytics  console,  the  console uses this operation to infer a schema
       and show it in the console user interface.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            discover-input-schema
          [--resource-arn <value>]
          --service-execution-role <value>
          [--input-starting-position-configuration <value>]
          [--s3-configuration <value>]
          [--input-processing-configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the streaming source.

       --service-execution-role (string)
          The ARN of the role that is used to access the streaming source.

       --input-starting-position-configuration (structure)
          The point at which you want Kinesis Data Analytics to start  reading
          records from the specified streaming source discovery purposes.

          InputStartingPosition -> (string)
              The starting position on the stream.

              o NOW  -  Start reading just after the most recent record in the
                stream, and start at the request timestamp that  the  customer
                issued.

              o TRIM_HORIZON  -  Start reading at the last untrimmed record in
                the stream, which  is  the  oldest  record  available  in  the
                stream.  This  option  is  not available for an Amazon Kinesis
                Data Firehose delivery stream.

              o LAST_STOPPED_POINT - Resume reading from where the application
                last stopped reading.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InputStartingPosition=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {

          }

       --s3-configuration (structure)
          Specify  this  parameter to discover a schema from data in an Amazon
          S3 object.

          BucketARN -> (string)
              The ARN of the S3 bucket that contains the data.

          FileKey -> (string)
              The name of the object that contains the data.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          BucketARN=string,FileKey=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "BucketARN": "string",
            "FileKey": "string"
          }

       --input-processing-configuration (structure)
          The  InputProcessingConfiguration to use to preprocess  the  records
          before discovering the schema of the records.

          InputLambdaProcessor -> (structure)
              The  InputLambdaProcessor that is used to preprocess the records
              in the stream before being processed by your application code.

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of  the  Amazon  Lambda  function  that  operates  on
                 records in the stream.

                 NOTE:
                     To specify an earlier version of the Lambda function than
                     the latest, include the Lambda function  version  in  the
                     Lambda  function  ARN.  For more information about Lambda
                     ARNs, see Example ARNs: Amazon Lambda

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InputLambdaProcessor={ResourceARN=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "InputLambdaProcessor": {
              "ResourceARN": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       InputSchema -> (structure)
          The schema inferred from the streaming  source.  It  identifies  the
          format of the data in the streaming source and how each data element
          maps to corresponding columns in the in-application stream that  you
          can create.

          RecordFormat -> (structure)
              Specifies the format of the records on the streaming source.

              RecordFormatType -> (string)
                 The type of record format.

              MappingParameters -> (structure)
                 When  you configure application input at the time of creating

                 information specific to the record format (such as JSON, CSV,
                 or record fields delimited by some delimiter) on the  stream-
                 ing source.

                 JSONMappingParameters -> (structure)
                     Provides  additional mapping information when JSON is the
                     record format on the streaming source.

                     RecordRowPath -> (string)
                        The path to the top-level  parent  that  contains  the

                 CSVMappingParameters -> (structure)
                     Provides  additional  mapping information when the record

                     RecordRowDelimiter -> (string)
                        The row delimiter. For example, in a CSV  format,  'n'

                     RecordColumnDelimiter -> (string)
                        The  column delimiter. For example, in a CSV format, a
                        comma (",") is the typical column delimiter.

          RecordEncoding -> (string)
              Specifies the encoding of the records in the  streaming  source.
              For example, UTF-8.

          RecordColumns -> (list)
              A list of RecordColumn objects.

              (structure)
                 For a SQL-based Kinesis Data Analytics application, describes

                 Mapping -> (string)
                     A reference to the data element in the streaming input or
