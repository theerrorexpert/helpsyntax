                 by the application.

                 (structure)
                     When you configure the application input for a  SQL-based
                     Kinesis  Data  Analytics  application,  you  specify  the
                     streaming source, the in-application stream name that  is
                     created, and the mapping between the two.

                     NamePrefix -> (string)
                        The name prefix to use when creating an in-application
                        stream. Suppose that you specify a prefix  "MyInAppli-
                        cationStream  ."  Kinesis  Data Analytics then creates
                        one or more (as per  the  InputParallelism  count  you
                        specified) in-application streams with the names "MyI-

                     abled  ,  CheckpointInterval  ,  or MinPauseBetweenCheck-
                     points parameters.

                     NOTE:
                        If this value is set to DEFAULT , the application will
                        use  the  following  values,  even  if they are set to
                        other values using APIs or application code:

                        o CheckpointingEnabled: true

                     NOTE:
                        If     CheckpointConfiguration.ConfigurationType    is
                        DEFAULT , the application will use a  CheckpointingEn-
                        abled  value  of  true  , even if this value is set to
                        another value using this API or in application code.

                 CheckpointInterval -> (long)
                     Describes the interval in milliseconds between checkpoint
                     operations.

                     NOTE:
                        If     CheckpointConfiguration.ConfigurationType    is
                        DEFAULT , the application will use a  CheckpointInter-
                        val  value  of  60000,  even  if  this value is set to
                        another value using this API or in application code.

                 MinPauseBetweenCheckpoints -> (long)
                     Describes the minimum time in milliseconds after a check-
                     point operation completes that a new checkpoint operation
                     can start. If a checkpoint operation  takes  longer  than
                     the  CheckpointInterval  , the application otherwise per-
                     forms continual checkpoint operations. For more  informa-
                     tion,  see Tuning Checkpointing in the Apache Flink Docu-
                     mentation .

                     NOTE:
                        If    CheckpointConfiguration.ConfigurationType     is
                        DEFAULT  ,  the  application  will  use  a MinPauseBe-
                        tweenCheckpoints value of 5000, even if this value  is
                        set using this API or in application code.

                     Describes whether to use the default  CloudWatch  logging
                     configuration for an application. You must set this prop-
                     erty to CUSTOM in order to set the  LogLevel  or  Metric-
                     sLevel parameters.

                     Describes  the  granularity of the CloudWatch Logs for an
                     application. The Parallelism level is not recommended for
                     applications  with a Parallelism over 64 due to excessive
                     costs.

                     Describes whether the application uses the default paral-
                     lelism  for  the Kinesis Data Analytics service. You must
                     set this property to  CUSTOM  in  order  to  change  your
                     application's  AutoScalingEnabled , Parallelism , or Par-
                     allelismPerKPU properties.

                 Parallelism -> (integer)
                     Describes the initial number of  parallel  tasks  that  a
                     Flink-based  Kinesis  Data Analytics application can per-
                     form. If AutoScalingEnabled is set to True, Kinesis  Data
                     Analytics   increases  the  CurrentParallelism  value  in
                     response to application load. The  service  can  increase
                     the  CurrentParallelism value up to the maximum parallel-
                     ism, which is ParalellismPerKPU times  the  maximum  KPUs
                     for  the application. The maximum KPUs for an application
                     is 32 by default, and can be increased  by  requesting  a
                     limit  increase. If application load is reduced, the ser-
                     vice can reduce the CurrentParallelism value down to  the
                     Parallelism setting.

                 ParallelismPerKPU -> (integer)
                     Describes the number of parallel tasks that a Flink-based
                     Kinesis Data Analytics application can perform per  Kine-
                     sis  Processing  Unit  (KPU) used by the application. For

          number of application tags includes system tags. The maximum  number
          of  user-defined  application  tags is 50. For more information, see
          Using Tagging .

          (structure)
              A key-value pair (the value is optional) that you can define and
              assign  to  Amazon  resources. If you specify a tag that already
              exists, the tag value is replaced with the value that you  spec-
              ify  in the request. Note that the maximum number of application
              tags includes system tags. The maximum  number  of  user-defined
              application  tags is 50. For more information, see Using Tagging
              .

              Key -> (string)

       --application-mode (string)
          Use the STREAMING mode to create a  Kinesis  Data  Analytics  Studio
          notebook.  To  create  a Kinesis Data Analytics Studio notebook, use
          the INTERACTIVE mode.

          Possible values:

          o STREAMING

          o INTERACTIVE

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                        checkpoint  operation  completes that a new checkpoint
                        operation can start.

                        NOTE:
                            If  CheckpointConfiguration.ConfigurationType   is
                            DEFAULT  ,  the application will use a MinPauseBe-
                            tweenCheckpoints value of 5000, even if this value
                            is set using this API or in application code.

                 MonitoringConfigurationDescription -> (structure)
                     Describes  configuration parameters for Amazon CloudWatch
                     logging for an application.

                        Flink-based Kinesis  Data  Analytics  application  can
                        perform.  If  AutoScalingEnabled  is set to True, then
                        Kinesis Data Analytics can increase the  CurrentParal-
                        lelism value in response to application load. The ser-
                        vice can increase CurrentParallelism up to the maximum
                        parallelism, which is ParalellismPerKPU times the max-
                        imum KPUs for the application. The maximum KPUs for an
                        application  is 32 by default, and can be increased by
                        requesting a limit increase. If  application  load  is
                        reduced, the service can reduce the CurrentParallelism
                        value down to the Parallelism setting.

                     ParallelismPerKPU -> (integer)
                        Describes  the  number  of  parallel  tasks   that   a
                        Flink-based  Kinesis  Data  Analytics  application can
                        perform per Kinesis Processing Unit (KPU) used by  the
                        application.

                     CurrentParallelism -> (integer)
                        Describes  the current number of parallel tasks that a
                        Flink-based Kinesis  Data  Analytics  application  can
                        perform. If AutoScalingEnabled is set to True, Kinesis
                        Data Analytics can increase this value in response  to
                        application  load. The service can increase this value
                        up to the maximum parallelism, which  is  Paralellism-
                        PerKPU times the maximum KPUs for the application. The
                        maximum KPUs for an application is 32 by default,  and
                        can  be  increased  by requesting a limit increase. If
                        application load is reduced, the  service  can  reduce
                        the  CurrentParallelism  value down to the Parallelism
                        setting.
