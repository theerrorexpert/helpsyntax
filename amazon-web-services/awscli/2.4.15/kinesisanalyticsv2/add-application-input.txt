ADD-APPLICATION-INPUT()                                ADD-APPLICATION-INPUT()



NAME
       add-application-input -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds a streaming source to your SQL-based Kinesis Data Analytics appli-
       cation.

       You can add a streaming source when you create an application,  or  you
       can  use  this  operation to add a streaming source after you create an
       application. For more information, see  CreateApplication .

       Any configuration update, including adding  a  streaming  source  using
       this  operation,  results  in a new version of the application. You can
       use the  DescribeApplication operation to find the current  application
       version.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The  name  of your existing application to which you want to add the
          streaming source.

       --current-application-version-id (long)
          The current version of your application. You must provide the Appli-
          cationVersionID   or   the   ConditionalToken   .You   can  use  the
          DescribeApplication operation to find the current  application  ver-
          sion.

       --input (structure)
          The  Input to add.

          NamePrefix -> (string)
              The  name  prefix to use when creating an in-application stream.
              Suppose that you  specify  a  prefix  "MyInApplicationStream  ."
              Kinesis  Data  Analytics  then  creates  one or more (as per the
              InputParallelism count  you  specified)  in-application  streams
              with  the  names "MyInApplicationStream_001 ," "MyInApplication-
              Stream_002 ," and so on.

          InputProcessingConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  InputProcessingConfiguration for the input. An  input  pro-
              cessor  transforms records as they are received from the stream,
              before the application's SQL code executes. Currently, the  only
              input  processing configuration available is  InputLambdaProces-
              sor .

              InputLambdaProcessor -> (structure)
                 The  InputLambdaProcessor that  is  used  to  preprocess  the
                 records in the stream before being processed by your applica-
                 tion code.

                 ResourceARN -> (string)
                     The ARN of the Amazon Lambda function  that  operates  on

                     NOTE:
                        To  specify  an earlier version of the Lambda function
                        than the latest, include the Lambda  function  version
                        in the Lambda function ARN. For more information about

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
